Congress, though DMK’s ‘biggest’ ally, has got just 25 seats against 41 it got in the 2016 assembly election (the party won just eight of them). The two national parties’ diminutive, dependent status in the state is comparable, yet the reasons are a study in contrast: Congress has had a stunted existence here for half a century, while BJP has not been able to strike enough roots to win seats even in two digits. The party that lost power in TN in 1967 and never got better, has become a willing and subservient partner of DMK, which is confident of forming the next government after being in opposition for ten years. The seat shares show that the southern state remains an impenetrable fort of the two regional giants who have systematically refused to give the national parties anything more than a supporting role.%s
Therefore, this is New Delhi’s chance to seriously contribute towards peace in Afghanistan, protect its legitimate interests there and neutralise Pakistan’s strategy of using Afghanistan as strategic depth against India. First, in a letter to Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, US secretary of state Anthony Blinken proposed a transitional peace government for Afghanistan followed by national elections and a UN-led conference of India, Russia, China, Pakistan, Iran and the US to discuss a unified approach on Afghanistan. Second, a draft peace agreement from Washington proposes that the said transitional Afghan government include Taliban while setting out guiding principles for a new Afghan constitution.%s
Amid BJP’s upswing, the youthful turn, the slow eclipse of Chandy – popular among people but a factionalist in equal measure – and the impending rise of his rivals Ramesh Chennithala and K Muraleedharan may help Congress regain the Nair vote. Congress may just have tapped into this wellspring of discontent by awarding over 50% of tickets to newcomers, something Rahul Gandhi can take credit for, after fruitlessly pursuing such a course since 2008.Youth Congress last enjoyed a similar upsurge in the 1970s, propelling AK Antony, Oommen Chandy and all of today’s national veteran cohort. No communist CM enjoyed Vijayan’s luxury of firm control over both government and party, leading to derisive Congress chants of “Kerala Modi”. To complicate the picture Kerala also witnesses seat-by-seat fights trumping the state narrative, owing to many hardworking MLAs and imaginative challengers creating their own local narratives. ” universal monthly kit comprising pulses, oils, spices and other essential items, which cushioned household expenditure during the pandemic.

No country can claim to be truly self-reliant as manufacture of key ingredients such as adjuvants and bioreactors is spread across a global supply chain. The collaboration spread the financial risks of development and production of vaccines across countries to make a quick response possible. If the worst case prognosis of a year ago seems unlikely, we should thank an unprecedented collaborative effort between governments, multilateral public health alliances, regulators and companies. The key players in the vaccine supply chain, particularly the US, UK, EU and India, need to take matters in hand. Last year’s collaboration was spurred by the understanding that in a pandemic no one is safe till everyone is safe.%s
While TMC has felt the pressure ever since BJP’s strong showing in 2019’s Lok Sabha polls, a surprise has been the grand alliance in Assam which is attempting to prevent the splintering of anti-BJP votes. The first phase in Bengal kicks off predominantly from constituencies in the Jangalmahal region, where BJP had fared exceedingly well in 2019.The Naxalite resurgence here had exemplified three decades of CPM failures, and TMC’s developmental works during its first term bolstered CM Banerjee’s popularity in the region. With BJP too making a strong developmental pitch, the choice between a national and regional party will play heavily on the voter’s mind.%s
More than a year after the Supreme Court said that the army’s short service commission women officers are all entitled to permanent commission, it has again affirmed equality by pointing out that women can’t be judged, and found wanting, solely by the settings of a man-made world. As they continue to press for more parity in the defence forces, the court’s reminder about implicit gender biases and structural justice will serve as a guide to the institution – and for the rest of us. 86 senior women officers had petitioned the court about arbitrary evaluation standards, pegged to the fitness levels of a 35-year-old man.%s
In the budget session of Parliament, the Centre informed the Lok Sabha that of the sanctioned strength of 1080 judges in the Supreme Court and 25 High Courts put together, the vacancy level is 39%.Read also: SC collegium picks 13 names for Bombay high court judge postsAs on 1st March, there were 66,727 cases pending with the Supreme Court. The friction between the judiciary and the government over the time taken to appoint judges spilled out in the open yesterday. The process of appointing a judge involves the chief justices of the Supreme Court and High Courts initiating a proposal for appointment.%s
In any case Bangladesh’s surge in living standards – it may have surpassed eastern India in this respect – and success in garments and textile industries which already employ millions, mean that the problem of illegal immigration belongs more to the past and there’s little point being overly exercised about it today. There’s therefore a nice symbolic symmetry to the fact that India’s PM will be chief guest at the 50th anniversary of Bangladesh’s founding, which also happens to be the birth centenary year of its founder father Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. That much of Bangladesh’s surge happened in Hasina’s time, even as she dramatically improved relations with India, shows how much regional cooperation can be achieved in South Asia which mostly has a sorry history of the opposite kind – of regional antagonism or at least neglect. There’s no denying that history binds the two nations together, given the key role that India played in Bangladesh’s liberation struggle.%s
Consider the schoolgirl whose allegations of sexual harassment in the wake of last year’s #BoisLockerRoom scandal were followed by her ex-classmate’s suicide, and who’s now set to face trial for abetment to suicide at a juvenile court. Last year the nation was convulsed by Sushant Singh Rajput’s suicide and last week saw the shocking suicide of young wrestler Ritika Phogat. But there’s little doubt that the burden of stress, anxiety, depression and mental health disorders has risen dreadfully over the past year. There’s a school of thought that children are resilient and this will help them withstand the pandemic well, provided proper material and emotional support is available.%s
Delhi’s electorate has given AAP two successive large majorities in the assembly elections and the apex court has stressed on the primacy of the elected representatives in some areas of Delhi’s functioning. This legislation will undermine cooperation between the Centre and opposition administered states as the debates in the Parliament showed that many of them interpreted the bill as an attempt to undermine state legislatures. The essence of the bill is that it shifts the balance of power between the elected government of Delhi and the Lieutenant Governor in favour of the latter.%s
A five-judge constitution bench is weighing arguments in a case where Maharashtra expanded the reservation limit for socially and educationally backward groups beyond 50% by creating a special dispensation for the Maratha community. Among the first constitutional amendments was one that created a special dispensation for socially and educationally backward classes, to provide for reservation in education and jobs. The 50% cap was breached a couple of years ago when an amendment was passed providing additional 10% reservation for economically weaker sections. India’s reservation policy no longer adheres to the spirit of the fundamental right to equality, as it exists in the Constitution. If political parties are too craven to halt this populist lurch, it behoves SC to provide them some cover and uphold the Constitution’s spirit. The Maratha reservation case assumes salience because not only have many states supported the breach of 50% cap, even the Centre has backed it. The underlying logic is that this is already an extremely high ceiling for special dispensations; expanding them further can only be at the cost of merit and the right to equality.%s
Field trials will help governments, scientists, seed companies and farmers transparently assess the claims of transgenic crops repelling pests and boosting productivity. In deciding to consider proposals for GM crop field trials only upon the recommendation of state governments, Centre has signalled a retreat in another arena of farm reforms. Last year, central regulator Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC) allowed biosafety field trials of two new transgenic Bt Brinjal varieties in eight states. Dangerous trends like farmers growing unapproved transgenic varieties of cotton and brinjal were reported amid stalling of trials.%s
But information placed by the government in the Rajya Sabha yesterday showed that the transition to more genetically modified crops under a water tight regulatory regime is likely to be delayed. For over a decade, India has seen hectic lobbying in relation to the regulatory approval process of another genetically modified crop, Bt Brinjal. The Centre has decided that field trials of genetically modified crops will not be taken up without the recommendation of a state where it can be carried out.%s
Low turnout and price controls, bottlenecks in supply and vaccine unavailability with preferred private providers, could be factors diminishing the private sector’s enthusiasm. The revision also recognises ground realities: Chennai Corporation’s PHCs have begun vaccinating individuals above 18 years of age to reduce vaccine wastage and improve capacity utilisation. Just 13% of the 40,000 vaccination sites on Saturday were private facilities and average turnout after 16 lakh inoculations was just 40 per site. States and private hospitals must be allowed to source vaccines directly and adapt inoculation strategies to tackle localised infection surges and hesitancy/ ignorance among diverse groups. Simultaneously, vaccines that pass Phase 3 trials in advanced jurisdictions abroad should be granted emergency use authorisation, like Covaxin was, to help find local manufacturing partners and expedite their production and supply. Against vaccination capacity of 60,000 daily, Chennai’s civic body achieved only 32,000 on Saturday and a paltry 18,000 on Monday, thereby necessitating such moves.%s
It should leave the news media out of a regulatory framework that aims to curb fake news on social media. Invoked without consulting stakeholders, the order force fits news media with social media platforms. In addition, the mechanism of complaint redressal prescribed by the executive order will escalate compliance costs for media platforms. The redressal mechanism, which is based on a three-tier system, requires media companies to have a time-bound response system. It sets the stage for an inspector raj in the functioning of media which is the antithesis of a free press. The most worrisome dimension of the specifics of the executive order is that it gives the bureaucracy extraordinary powers to meddle with content on flimsy grounds.%s
Quietly, Chennai civic clinics vaccinating those over 18 What is pushing even government centres to circumvent rules to vaccinate people not on the beneficiary list is that the vaccines have a shelf life. However, anecdotal evidence suggests that people outside the beneficiary list who are getting vaccine shots in PHC haven’t had to pay anything. The Tamil Nadu government’s primary health centres have been quietly vaccinating people who are not part of the beneficiary list. In order to avoid wastage, PHCs have been vaccinating people outside the beneficiary list.%s
Given the enormous expenditure running into crores that political parties incur on the campaign trail, distributing free masks at rallies will hardly tax their purses (wholesale prices of surgical masks have dropped below Re 1 and of N95 masks to Rs 10). Despite the sharpest weekly Covid surge – last week’s fresh infection count of 2.6 lakh was 1.05 lakh cases more than the week before – While there’s still time, leading politicians from the PM and CMs down to Union/ state ministers and top opposition leaders must insist on masking at their rallies. A number of people are testing positive daily in Haridwar questioning the wisdom of Uttarakhand CM Tirath Singh Rawat overturning his predecessor’s decision to mandate Covid negative certificates. Lakhs of livelihoods are again threatened, but potentially superspreader events like the multi-state election campaigns and the Kumbh Mela in Haridwar are being glossed over even as they violate all Covid safety norms. This sarkari attitude defends peremptory imposition of lockdowns by blaming social distancing violations for forcing their hand.%s
An egregious case is the decision of Tamil Nadu’s AIADMK government to subcategorise the state’s MBC reserved category just hours before election dates were announced. Along with measures such as conditional cash transfers unrelated to group identities, political parties are simultaneously slicing and dicing the electorates into ever more vote banks. The fallout of this phenomenon will be the balkanisation of society as the message sent is that hardening of narrow group identities can translate into economic benefits. Election manifestos of political parties competing for seats in the forthcoming elections of five assemblies display a common thread. However, it’s another trend gaining traction that’s more worrisome. Eventually, India benefits when political parties avoid catering to narrow interests.%s
The India Justice Report 2020, a civil society initiative led by Tata Trusts, points out that the “police pillar” which is the Police Act 1861 needs a thorough overhaul. In 2005, the Centre started an exercise to reform this legislation by getting former attorney general Soli Sorabjee to draft an alternative law which is in sync with the needs of a parliamentary democracy. A colonial era legislation, Police Act 1861, guides the legal framework of policing.%s
The structural problem here is successive governments’ failure to implement police reforms, wherein the Supreme Court way back in 2006 had outlined various mechanisms for insulating police from extraneous pressures, making it autonomous in personnel matters, and ensuring high levels of accountability. The vehicle was traced to Mansukh Hiran, who was found dead, his wife pointed the finger at assistant police inspector Sachin Waze, who was arrested by NIA and then suspended even as Mumbai police commissioner Parambir Singh was transferred, and Singh has levelled explosive allegations of corruption against state home minister Anil Deshmukh. In the years since, governments have expanded police’s roles but without commensurate investment to modernise their functioning, or upgrade their autonomy and accountability. But the only long-term solution to the systemic abuse of law that’s being suspected right now, is police reforms.%s
The economic rationale for the government’s privatisation programme is to improve productivity of the firms it’s selling. India’s economic dynamism will be influenced by both the manner in which government deploys its resources and the efficiency of the private sector. Signals sent by the government influence decisions of firms, making communication an important channel to steer expectations. For employees of PSUs that are to be privatised there’s an understandable anxiety about what happens to existing commitments the government has made. Privatisation provides the best way for government to quickly reallocate scarce resources.%s
Rather than bristle at the criticism or withdraw again into an isolationist shell, NDA government must show greater confidence over free speech and democratic rights than its predecessors by repealing sedition, blasphemy and restrictive marriage laws. , widespread use of sedition laws, targeting of Bollywood citing hurt sentiments and curtailment of academic freedoms harm India’s soft power, which cannot be separated from its hard power. But it’s just as noticeable that Quad is shaping up into a fight by countries with shared democratic values, and any democratic backsliding in India would be perceived to be at odds with the new order.%s
This week it is Uttarakhand CM Tirath Singh Rawat who indulged himself on the occasion of a workshop on substance abuse, by waxing eloquent about his sensibilities being abused by girls wearing tattered jeans, boys wearing the same, knees showing, not covering their bodies properly, running after English education, women talking about all the things they want to do in life when the most important thing is to look after their family and kids. Too many desi uncles waste too much of their precious time lecturing youth on what is Western culture and what is Indian culture and exactly what proportions of these two are healthy for consumption. The lady in the ripped jeans who drove the CM to such despair has crafted her own equation with work and family, and this freedom is every Indian woman’s birthright.%s
Institutions like Ashoka University, a premier private venture that in a short period of time has managed to establish a reputation actually stretching to different parts of the world, in part by attracting international faculty talent, have held promise of a more vibrant educational future, where higher education attracts big investments, including foreign investments, upping the R&D game and helping Indian youth walk bright new paths. Noted economist Arvind Subramanian has also resigned, saying that it was “ominously disturbing” that the university could “no longer provide a space for academic expression and freedom”. With the widespread perception that Mehta’s resignation has been brought on by his strong critique of government policies, this episode will definitely give further traction to the rising global discourse on the decline of democracy in India. In education this creates an environment full of conformity, doubling down on learning by rote, when what is desperately needed for the dramatically changing global work conditions is Indians trained in critical thinking. The future of India’s youth is strongly tied to the excellence of its institutions of higher education.%s
Bihar’s JD(U), Odisha’s BJD and Delhi’s AAP can also claim to run state governments that enjoy greater women’s support with a heavy emphasis on education, women’s safety and service delivery. Rising women voter turnouts and Lokniti-CSDS post-poll surveys pointing to greater women backing for the ultimate victors reveal why the women’s vote is becoming prized. The struggles of women to earn their space in politics haven’t changed much but what’s certainly shifting is the political pursuit of the women’s vote. Women netas like Mamata Banerjee and late Jayalalithaa earned a special place among women voters by triumphing in an arena dominated entirely by men. Even the comprehensive 2019 BJP victory saw its women’s vote inch marginally closer to its male vote share. Days after AIADMK’s manifesto promising Rs 1,500 monthly allowances for housewives comes TMC offering monthly income support of Rs 500-1,000 for female heads of households, expected to benefit 80% of Bengal households.%s
Supreme Court has asked the Centre to respond to a PIL’s claim that nearly 30 million ration cards have been cancelled because they’re not linked to Aadhaar. It’s states who’re responsible for operational aspects of NFSA, including weeding out fake ration cards. Today, around 91% of ration cards are linked to Aadhaar database and more than 70% of transactions are done through biometric authentication. Between 2013 and 2020, almost 44 million ration cards were cancelled. Moreover, state-level data on cancellations of ration cards is odd.%s
The return of bad ideas – the lockdown and night curfew combination had shaved off a quarter of the national GDP in April-June 2020 – is indeed worrying. No one can make the case that a lockdown prompts people to be more public health conscious or the coronavirus spreads predominantly in the night hours or social distancing goes particularly awry then. A country that has exported 6 crore vaccine doses shouldn’t have to return to the lockdown mentality of last year, when options were fewer and understanding of the disease was limited. India has a long way to go having vaccinated just 2% of the country, with vaccine hesitancy being observed across age groups and social classes. Like the warped signalling on masks, the failure to combat misinformation on vaccines and ramp up vaccinations could also prove costly. But that would also greatly inconvenience the political class, many of whom, like Mamata Banerjee and JP Nadda in Bengal, are spotted unmasked in potentially super spreader election campaigns.%s
That’s the way to go but it remains to be seen if the government can avoid micromanagement in an institution it’s created. Acting on a Budget proposal, this week the Union Cabinet approved a detailed proposal for setting up a new development financial institution (DFI) to deal with this challenge. This resource base is expected to turbo charge India’s infrastructure development. Infrastructure development can be India’s highway to prosperity. In emerging nations, financial markets are not sophisticated enough to meet the full spectrum of development needs.%s
In fact, by insisting on Chinese vaccines for foreigners travelling to China, the Chinese Communist Party is forcing other nations to make Chinese vaccines available to their citizens when efficacy data on those vaccines remain opaque. China’s decision to allow in some foreigners from 20 countries – including India – provided they take Chinese-made Covid vaccines once again highlights that Beijing is determined to use anti-pandemic measures for strategic gains. Instead of freely working with international bodies to investigate the origin of the novel coronavirus – widely believed to have first emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan –%s
But with BJP’s poll campaign focussing on highlighting corruption and syndicate raj under the Mamata Banerjee regime, TMC turncoats getting preference over party old-timers can undermine the party’s message of poriborton. Unhappy with tickets being given to the new entrants – particularly from TMC – the party’s old guard are expressing their displeasure in inconvenient ways. Mamata has been playing up the fact she’s the only woman CM in the country today, stressing that Bengal wants to re-elect its own daughter – a not-so-subtle bid to project BJP as a party of outsiders. The party’s well-oiled electoral machinery has made unprecedented inroads in the state, a fact exemplified by the large number of netas from other parties flocking to its ranks. If she’s to scrape through, she would need TMC’s women vote bank to remain intact. In Hooghly, angry BJP supporters ransacked the party’s district office in Chinsurah and locked up the Chandernagore office.%s
By mandating LG’s opinion before any decision is taken, the amendment seeks to override SC’s ruling which held that Council of Ministers didn’t need to obtain LG’s “concurrence” on every issue of day to day governance. In stating that the “government” referred to in any law passed by the Delhi assembly “shall mean the Lieutenant Governor” the amendment ends the autonomy enjoyed by the AAP government and reduces it to a figurehead. The bill introduced in Lok Sabha to amend the Government of NCT of Delhi Act granting the lieutenant governor extensive powers to intervene in the functioning of the capital city’s elected government is a regressive move. The 2018 SC judgment that restricted Centre’s ambit to control over police, public order and land ensured an uneasy ceasefire, allowing Delhi’s administration to proceed relatively smoothly.%s
The country recorded 24,458 new cases on Monday with at least 11 states and UTs showing a significant rise in infections in the previous week. Hence, it is important to continue maintaining Covid safety protocols and ensure proper masking etiquette. Thus, all precautions must be taken to ensure that the South African strain does not spread widely in the country.%s
In 2018 a five-judge Constitution bench of the Supreme Court clarified that the Centre’s executive power over the National Capital Territory was “confined” to public order, police and land. Also read: Bill in Lok Sabha to give LG more power, stage set for Centre-AAP faceoffTo underline, elections mean the government’s accountability to citizens. Because this Bill makes it necessary for the Delhi government to obtain the “opinion” of the lieutenant governor before taking any executive action.%s
DMK’s sops include reserving 75% industrial jobs for locals, one-year maternity leave for women government employees, banning the NEET medical entrance exam, subsidised food, fuel, milk and transport. With free consumer goods, cash transfers, nativist appeals, and outreach to specific groups like youth and women, their manifestos span the entire spectrum of electoral populism. Tamil Nadu assembly election manifestos always attract national attention with the two main Dravidian parties promising generous freebies like mixers, grinders, television sets, cellphones and largely delivering them. Both Dravidian parties, which have admirably pursued continuity of industrial and education policies, must avoid the rising nativist tendencies in Indian politics and stay on top of the game of wooing global industrial majors to their state. A promise like prohibition, ostensibly targeting women, shrinks revenues which are otherwise needed to finance the freebies on offer.%s
However, in the run-up to the assembly polls, the old identity issues are centrestage as exemplified by BJP attacking Congress for its tie-up with Badruddin Ajmal’s AIUDF in the state. BJP’s strategy still rests on retaining its hold over Ahoms, caste Hindu Assamese and Bengali Hindus who voted for it in large numbers in both the 2016 assembly elections and the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. With Congress highlighting these contradictions, sticking to the Assam Accord to determine citizenship in Assam and stitching together a grand alliance of eight parties – including former BJP ally Bodoland People’s The state government there was seen to have done a decent job of administering welfare schemes, building new roads and even tackling the Covid pandemic.%s
Ironically, Beijing’s long-running defence of its record has been along the same lines as Jaishankar’s arguments – that western institutes are hypocrites and have no locus standi to comment on internal matters of other nations. But there’s no escaping the fact that concerns about erosion of freedoms and the state’s authoritarian turn have steadily increased in the last few years. After all, the Quad is billed to be a grouping of democracies with shared democratic values and common beliefs in international rules as opposed to China’s unilateral, hegemonic worldview. Foreign minister S Jaishankar’s strong defence of the government in the face of western human rights and democracy%s
The petitioner has opposed the Independence Day cutoff as “arbitrary, irrational and retrospective”, which prohibits Hindus and others from approaching courts to “reclaim” worship places “invaded” and “encroached” upon by “fundamentalist barbaric invaders”.Ironically, the petition is guilty of much arbitrariness and irrationality, which wasn’t seized to dismiss it. The Act won high praise from the 2019 SC bench that awarded the disputed land in Ayodhya to Hindus, noting that it “addresses itself to the State as much as to every citizen” and that its norms “bind those who govern the affairs of the nation at every level”.This law praised by SC has been challenged by a PIL, a mechanism many judges now frown upon for their tendency to arrogate governance and bog down judiciary in matters with no constitutional or justiciable issues at stake. Indeed, the Republic has to be future-oriented, accountable as it is to citizenry demanding fulfilment of their aspirations of development and material prosperity in the present day, rather than raking up events of a millennium ago (the latter, indeed, is a hallmark of fundamentalist thinking).The premise of August 15, 1947, was a break with history, guaranteeing equal rights to all people and freedom from discrimination. The State, has by enacting the law, enforced a constitutional commitment and operationalised its constitutional obligations to uphold the equality of all religions and secularism which is a part of the Constitution’s basic structure. Parliament enacted the law in 1991 to prevent conversion of religious places and maintain their “religious character%s
The first summit of Quad leaders last week saw the grouping definitively move to a concrete geopolitical fixture, with PM Modi describing it as a “force for global good” and an “important pillar of stability Similarly, when Japanese PM Suga spoke to Modi before the summit about China’s unilateral attempts to change the status quo in East and South China Seas, Hong Kong and Xinjiang, New Delhi’s readout of the conversation was silent on these issues. That said, the Quad evolving as a security-plus platform has certainly irked China which has been saying that India is a “negative asset” for Brics and SCO.%s
Rather than tight centralised controls, state governments and private healthcare providers must be allowed to negotiate prices and procure directly from vaccine manufacturers, who have excess stocks and underemployed manufacturing capacity. Instead of new lockdowns and movement restrictions in multiple Maharashtra districts to tackle an alarming Covid spike, what’s needed is an immediate overhaul of vaccination strategies. Centre assuring that all states have been adequately stocked for vaccines doesn’t answer why it’s shying away from liberalising vaccine distribution and administration. Meanwhile, why’s the conversation on masking – still the most effective and cheap virus suppression method amid vaccine rationing – so muted? Given private sector accounts for nearly two-third of healthcare footfall, vaccination sites should be skewing in their favour, not vice versa.%s
However, unlike the Unnao case that followed a similar arc or the Hathras case that saw horrific dereliction of duty and a political battle, there has been more lawful action in this case. While we therefore see lawlessness and impunity play out in many of these crimes, rape and its aftermath also have much to do with the pervasive patriarchal order where women are male property, and men are either protectors or predators. Because rape is seen as a crime against chastity and family honour, the response is to further cramp the lives of women, shut them in for their own safety.%s
The CPM’s expression of regret for hurting the sentiments of devotees over the incidents that took place at the Sabarimala hill shrine after the Kerala government’s decision to implement the Supreme Court decision on allowing women entry reflects an attempt to woo back voters alienated from the party.

The Biden administration’s strategic approach is a good one, and Delhi can ill-afford to procrastinate about siding with the West and like-minded countries seeking to uphold international rules and freedoms, due to fear of what Beijing might think or its own ideological hobby horses. It’s on the right track in seeking to firewall critical sectors from Chinese equipment and cyberattacks – such as the recent intrusions into India’s power infrastructure. Coming so soon in the Biden presidency, the summit signals his administration’s intent to pick up where the Trump administration left off in terms of balancing China’s aggressive behaviour. In fact, the US has already begun putting together a set of coalitions aimed at countering China’s dominance in key technologies like semiconductors, AI, quantum computing, surveillance technology etc. Today’s first summit meeting of the Quad countries – India, Japan, the US and Australia – elevates this format and cements its role as a key pillar of the free and open Indo-Pacific architecture.%s
The essence of FIT is that government, in consultation with RBI, fixed an inflation target to guide the central bank’s monetary policy. In August 2016, government legislated a new approach to managing inflation called flexible inflation targeting (FIT). If there’s a change to be made by the government, it should be to expand the ambit of policy rates to include reverse repo rate, or the interest rate at which RBI absorbs liquidity from banks. RBI’s legislation clearly calls for keeping inflation under check while being mindful of growth. Keeping inflation under check has always been RBI’s main aim, but approaches have evolved with time. Evidence shows that it’s met the goals and India has experienced a relatively benign phase of inflation.%s
The prolonged eight-phase poll schedule for the state will try the state police and central paramilitary forces to the hilt. Now with Mamata’s protege-turned-rival Suvendu Adhikari joining the contest against her in Nandigram, the stakes have upped manifold.

On Tuesday, 4,681 private facilities accounted for 6.5 lakh planned vaccinations – nearly 140 daily per centre – while 17,724 government sites with a capacity for 29 lakh vaccinations garnered around 14 lakh inoculations. India’s 2.4 crore doses pale before other vaccine superpowers like the US and China; India is trailing in total doses administered and percentage of population inoculated. A cold chain network with capacity to store 2 crore doses at a time, and phenomenal capabilities of the likes of Serum Institute to produce 5 crore doses monthly, demanded a more ambitious programme than the one India witnessed. Instead of government control over the distribution pipeline, allow private providers to source directly from vaccine suppliers and roll out all vaccines passing Phase 3 trials. For a country blessed with incredible vaccine infrastructure, denying vaccines to the general population betrays a scarcity mentality. India’s class and digital divides are reflecting in the low vaccine offtake among the poor and those without smartphones. On the contrary, India’s large population needs rapid vaccination for herd immunity to kick in.%s
Managing the new entrants and staving off friction with the old guard will be a crucial challenge for the party in state elections ahead. After all, the state has never given any party consecutive terms in government and BJP would be wary of anti-incumbency building up. In some rapid developments in Uttarakhand, Trivendra Singh Rawat handed in his resignation as CM of the state, continuing with the trend of incumbents failing to complete their full term in office. All of this boiled over after Trivendra Singh recently announced Gairsain as the third administrative division in the state by including Almora, a move opposed by the people of the Kumaon region for reasons of cultural identity.%s
The resignation of Trivendra Singh Rawat as Uttarakhand chief minister a year before assembly polls shows BJP as a party that doesn’t make the same electoral mistake twice. In Jharkhand, it had ignored the unpopularity of chief minister Raghubar Das and the dissidence of senior leader Saryu Roy and paid a heavy price. With Uttarakhand’s history of booting out incumbents every five years, the incoming CM will have a tough task regaining lost ground in the next ten months.%s
While reforms like GST visualise India as a unified market, burgeoning reservations proceed in the opposite direction by fragmenting the labour market – even as constitutional rights such as right to equality and right to migrate to other states in search of livelihood are denied. Slowing economic growth and success of various groups in enlisting under OBC/ SC/ ST categories and easing creamy layer ceilings have created social divides that can’t be solved – but may be worsened – by more reservations. In that respect, Indra Sawhney attempted to balance the right to equality and state’s prerogative for socio-economic justice with the 50% cap. While merit doesn’t factor in socio-economic inequalities that prevent many people from attaining their potential, no society can progress if merit gets the short shrift. Proponents of nativism and caste identities would do better for their people by working to improve education outcomes in local schools, a major determinant of a person’s worldly prospects.%s
In an interview with Oprah Winfrey, also the world’s first black female billionaire, Meghan has talked about being faced with deep-rooted racism from the start, including “concerns and conversations” about how dark her child’s skin might turn out to be. As many global eyeballs as these revelations have grabbed, there are plenty of people who’re not at all surprised, given how “the firm” is neck deep in hierarchy and heredity. It’s great when brides no longer accept being “50% less” and grooms stand by them.%s
Also read: Maharashtra: Limited lockdown in 16 Thane hotspots Blunt instruments like lockdowns, on the other hand, allow the state to abdicate its responsibilities in capacity expansion, be it testing, vaccinating, improving healthcare facilities and imposing fines on those violating masking rules.

It’s a safety valve meant to avoid a situation such as the one where the government offered to negotiate clauses of the farm laws and even temporarily suspend its operation during negotiations with representatives of agitating farmers. The current session is taking place in the backdrop of farmers persisting with their agitation against the three central farm laws, which were passed amidst controversy last September. In addition, the government indicated it has an ambitious legislative agenda and plans to introduce bills covering a wide spectrum of subjects. In the current session, government plans to table important economic legislation. In this context, the idea of truncating the current session on account of elections to five assemblies makes no sense. The events leading to the passage of the laws and their fallout highlight the importance of parliamentary debate. It’s the duty of elected representatives to scrutinise legislation in detail and seek explanations from the bureaucracy.%s
This was India’s 13th consecutive Test series victory at home, highlighting the team’s dominance in subcontinental conditions. It’s a testimony to how far Indian cricket has evolved that our players are no longer seen as poor travellers or flat track bullies. India’s recent emphatic Test series win over England has secured them a place in the World Test Championship (WTC) final in England this summer. Then in the home series against South Africa in October 2019 it was Mayank Agarwal, skipper Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma who batted the opposition out of the three matches.%s
The sealing of the DMK-Congress alliance with the national party bagging just 25 seats is an indication of how Congress is fast losing ground. However, rather than ad hoc roles, it is time Congress settles the vacuum at the top and elect a full time party president. Similarly, in Bihar Congress wrested 74 seats but could win just 19, badly letting down the alliance in the process.%s
To the court’s complaint that the new rules for intermediaries and digital media “are lacking in teeth”, solicitor general Tushar Mehta granted that “no censorship, and self-regulation seem to be the idea behind the new regulations. Even as the streaming industry was grappling with all the dampening implications of the Centre’s new IT rules, a Supreme Court bench has gone further by asking for “screening” of content on OTT platforms. This conversation was taking place in the context of Amazon Prime’s content chief seeking pre-arrest bail in the case against the web series Tandav, a plea that had been turned down by Allahabad high court despite the concerned scenes having been deleted. The challenge of censorship becomes clear in terms of the court’s other plaint, that in some cases OTT platforms are showing pornography in the name of movies. When the same content is varyingly received by this multitude as erotic or pornographic or romantic or artistic etc, a government led oversight authority making judgment on all their behalf would be dangerously undemocratic, besides destroying market opportunity. The way forward lies in OTT platforms implementing a self-regulation code, which includes global best practices in age-appropriate certification.%s
It’s understandable that some voters wonder if this election is a contest between Trinamool’s A and B teams. Change is the recurring theme in election campaigns but the fluid switchovers of Bengal’s politicians underline that the state needs something more than just rhetoric to witness meaningful poriborton. The area provided a springboard for TMC’s subsequent ascent to power and Adhikari played a key role in it. It’s also a symbol of the unmet challenges of economic development that Mamata once seemed to herald. Adhikari was not too long ago one of Mamata’s key political associates.%s
A touch of novelty has come to mark the hotly contested Kerala assembly elections with Metroman E Sreedharan lending his heft to BJP amid Congress-led UDF making a determined effort to oust CPM-led LDF. Given Kerala’s high unemployment rate among youth – highest nationally in 2019-20 according to Periodic Labour Force Survey – the blowback will be felt. Possessing a credible 15% voteshare, BJP’s best hopes of breaching Kerala rest on wooing either the Muslim or Christian minority communities or largescale desertions from Congress/CPM. Meanwhile, a BJP candidate has notched up prized Orthodox Church support for helping spare an ancient church from demolition during highway construction.%s
Moderna jab this week and belted out her anthemic Jolene anew: “Vaccine, vaccine, vaccine, vaccine, And everyone else take note how she went to take her shot in a vaccine-ready outfit, smart cutouts even eliminating the need to roll up her sleeve.

In unfavourable conditions, India pulled off another series victory to cap a season where a bunch of talented individuals pulled together to beat two formidable sides at home. Over the next five days, India earned a hard fought victory that would seal the series and start one of the most memorable phases in the history of Indian cricket.
 It was the second test of the series in which the home side was led by the legendary Gary Sobers.%s
While India’s score of 34/40 in political rights tallied with many “free” countries, a dismal 33/60 score in civil liberties dragged it down to the level of “partly free” countries with failing democracies. Such moves would also reverse the trend of India’s soft power taking a big hit, latest evidence coming from the ‘Freedom in the World 2021’ report where India has fallen from “Free” to “Partly Free” status. Supreme Court’s rejection of a PIL pleading for invoking sedition against veteran Kashmiri politician Farooq Abdullah, for his opposition to Article 370 nullification, calls for rethink by the top court on sedition’s constitutionality.%s
A decisive influence on the outcome may be the incumbent AIADMK government’s last minute decision to carve out a sub-quota for the Vanniyar community within the MBC reserved category. Tamil Nadu’s forthcoming assembly elections will be the first one in ages without M Karunanidhi or J Jayalalithaa, dominant political personalities of their time. First, Rajnikanth made his long anticipated political debut with the promise of an ambiguous “spiritual politics”. She too didn’t stay long and has “stepped aside”.Where does that leave the state’s politics? The intriguing question is whether the coming polls will open up more space for non-Dravidian political formations.%s
Separately, another media report pointed out that there was a drop in income tax returns filed of salaried tax payers for the year 2019-20, a period in which the economy grew 4%.These economic indicators highlight the need for caution in interpreting GDP data. In a period when the economy is subjected to a severe shock, like the lockdown, there is a strong possibility the first cut of GDP data overstates the economic performance.%s
On many such fronts, be it Supreme Court directing CCTV camera installations with night vision and audio recording at police stations and other investigating agencies covering interrogation rooms, lockups, entries and exits, police reforms are low priority for the political class. Activists accused of criminal conspiracy in the northeast Delhi riots have charged police with leaking chargesheets to the media before courts took cognisance and copies were furnished to them.   A northeast Delhi riots case where police arraigned two men as accused for attempted murder speaks volumes about criminal investigation in the country. Such false or poorly investigated cases also highlight the dangers of media trials, with police or netas having vested interest in shaping public opinion on probes in a certain way. Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat discharging Babu and Imran for the attempted murder charge, but accepting  prima facie evidence to charge them with rioting and similar offences It is also the political class that must take the blame for recurring communal riots in India, stemming from shoddy investigations that often incriminate innocents while failing to catch and punish the actual rioters.%s
It will drive jobs out of the state as it makes it unviable for businesses to follow the law in letter and spirit, reducing the total number of jobs available. It’s obligatory for employers to adjust recruitment in a way that 75% of jobs that pay a gross monthly salary of up to Rs 50,000 are reserved for locals. The law does carve out exceptions by allowing employers to seek permission for waivers if there are not enough qualified locals available. The other consequence is that it will encourage informalisation of labour, as employers look for ways to both compete in the market and follow the law. To put it in context, Haryana has reserved 75% of jobs that pay up to almost five times%s
The state government in Manipur became the first state to initiate action against a digital media portal under the ambit of the recently introduced Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code)Rules, 2021. Govt’s new rules for social media, OTT platforms give it power to take down contentIndia’s experience with draconian laws like sedition No matter the umpteen judicial verdicts that detail circumstances under which sedition can be invoked, numerous people are jailed for inordinate periods under the law merely to suppress dissent.%s
Fumbling for answers to the BJP juggernaut, India’s “secular” parties must refocus on continuing the secular success of the 1991 reforms and attempt to broadbase it without succumbing to identity politics. Siddiqui’s little-known Indian Secular Front in cahoots with another declining “secular” force, CPM. An outburst in Congress over its alignment with Muslim cleric Abbas Siddiqui in Bengal underscores the dilemma facing “secular” parties amid the rightward shift in Indian politics since 2014. In Assam and Kerala Congress, the original votary of Hindu-Muslim unity and secular nationalism, has the tough option of striking out alone without AIUDF and IUML, to arrest the reverse polarisation and charges of “minority appeasement”. By feeding off Muslim grievances but steadfastly keeping his distance from mainstream “secular” outfits, some see Owaisi as a legitimate voice of Muslim dissent while others rue his fragmenting of the Muslim vote. Asaduddin Owaisi’s rise after BJP’s resurgence in a hardline avatar since 2014 has also divided the secular camp.%s
It bears reminding that Mumbai’s grid failure brought its trains and financial markets to a screeching halt, leaving hospitals scrambling for generators in the high noon of the pandemic, making it plain in just a couple of hours how extensive economic damage can be caused by digitally crippling the power infrastructure. A new study by the American company Recorded Future underlines systematic cyberintrusions by Chinese state-sponsored groups attempting to gain a foothold in “critical nodes across the Indian power generation and transmission infrastructure”. But as the Biden administration’s caution in calling the widespread SolarWinds hack a ‘Russian attack’ also suggests, plausible deniability is a key feature of successful state-sponsored cyber espionage and hostilities. Although talk of a Digital Geneva Convention will not go far in today’s polarised world, India must work closely with like-minded countries to share intelligence and neutralise cyberattacks, while protecting the privacy of citizens.%s
No country is insulated from cyber sabotage and India needs to be prepared at all levels for not only an increase in cyber security incidents, but also the possibility that sophisticated state backed hackers will be looking for vulnerabilities.

All the ingredients that can make this happen – more vaccine approvals, more manufacturing capacity, an open vaccine market and more private vaccination centres – can translate into a big 2021 GDP bump. So far, vaccination hasn’t matched up to India’s immense population challenge but the opening of centres at neighbourhood private hospitals and flexible options for registration can give a big boost. Against India administering vaccine doses to 1% of the population, those with comparable vaccine manufacturing capacity like the US and UK have covered 20% and 30% respectively of their population. After 42 days of vaccination, India has just dispensed 14 million doses while the cumulative world tally was 240 million doses. Since February 13, India’s seven-day rolling average of daily Covid infections has also shown a steady surge, signalling fresh need to ramp up vaccination. In kicking off the third phase of vaccination for senior citizens and those above 45 with comorbidities by getting himself inoculated, PM Modi has given a promising impetus to the pace of vaccination.%s
One of the positive features of the current ceasefire is that it appears to have the backing of the Pakistan army and the joint statement said that existing mechanisms will be used to resolve any “unforeseen situation or misunderstanding”.But none of these features insulate the process from terror groups who have arisen in the wake of Pakistan’s strategic approach of using them to further its aims. Even now, far from indicating that Pakistan is willing to give up terrorism as an instrument of state policy, PM Imran Khan has said that the onus is on India to create an “enabling environment for further progress”. It’s come after three consecutive years of increase in ceasefire violations.%s
The Centre will procure the vaccines and use state governments, and private healthcare providers affiliated to state medical insurance schemes to carry out the vaccination drive. India kicked off an important phase in its vaccination drive this morning by roping in private healthcare providers to augment the effort.%s
For instance, a strong opposition voice like Mamata Banerjee losing sway over Bengal will signal a version of pan-India primacy of BJP.Not surprisingly, the contestation is fiercest in Bengal, with both sides boasting evenly matched resources. With Mamata invoking Bengali pride to counter the rush of Hindi heartland leaders campaigning against her, BJP is making a strong pitch for “poriborton” and attempting to ride anti-incumbency in Bengal. The announcement of dates for Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Assam and Puducherry assembly elections has focussed attention on the strong repercussions their outcome will have for national politics. Consequently, BJP will face greater questioning over farm policy, high fuel prices and attempts to pursue economic reforms like privatisation. But an assembly election may dim Modi’s traction, requiring local leaders to up their game.%s
While there’s something to be said about Test matches not lasting the full five days – perhaps this is an impact of T20 cricket – imputing biases here is uncalled for. Then there is the statistic of India’s pink-ball Test matches – like Ahmedabad – ending within three days. Plus, their rotation policy has already seen players like Moeen Ali – whose spin could have helped at Ahmedabad – go home. The controversy over the pitch in the third India-England Test match at Ahmedabad has seen former English cricketers like Michael Vaughan, Andrew Strauss and David Lloyd question the spinning track that was offered to the visitors which saw them lose within two days. There’s no denying that every home team prepares pitches according to local conditions.%s
And now, at a time when news media are already battling adverse economic and legal environments, with serious charges like sedition being levelled on frivolous grounds, a whole new set of compliance measures will bring fresh costs and dangers. Government’s aim to impose accountability on social media to tackle a pandemic of fake news and hatred is sound. But the way in which these rules force-fit social media, streaming entertainment, and digital news portals all under one umbrella, is untenable. Leave alone discussing these far-reaching changes with stakeholders in digital news, government has sidestepped even a cursory parliamentary scrutiny by introducing the sweeping regulatory framework as subordinate legislation.%s
affidavit rejected a fundamental right to same sex marriage, noting its incompatibility with the “Indian family unit concept of a husband, a wife and children, which necessarily presuppose a biological man as ‘husband’, a biological woman as ‘wife’ and the children born out of the union between the two. Denying these benefits of a marital union to couples whose relationship gained legal acceptance in 2018 can be interpreted as a denial of their fundamental rights to life with dignity, equality before law, and right against discrimination by the state on grounds of gender. With same sex couples approaching Delhi high court for legal sanctity of marriage to their relationships, how long can Centre oppose the idea that has gained gradual acceptance in progressive jurisdictions?%s
Ties thaw, but experts doubt ceasefire will lastThat said, from India’s point of view, any peace overtures from Pakistan have to be backed by concrete action against anti-India terror groups operating from Pakistani soil. In fact, ceasefire violations from Pakistan had started spiking in 2019 after the Balakot surgical strike by India and New Delhi’s nullification of Article 370 vis-a-vis Kashmir. US welcomes India-Pakistan joint statement on ceasefireThus, while the ceasefire commitment is welcome it remains to be seen if it will lead to a reduction in cross-border infiltration of terrorists from Pakistan. Cross-border firing last year broke all records since the last 18 years, causing much distress to populations living along the LoC and the international border in Jammu & Kashmir. India, Pakistan agree to follow all ceasefire pactsIt could also be a signal to the new Joe Biden administration in the US that Pakistan is willing to reset ties with Washington. And the ceasefire bid could be Bajwa’s and Imran’s%s
If capacity still goes unutilised – theoretically 30,000 sites should deliver 30 lakh vaccine doses daily – the vaccination strategy must be flexible enough to allow other adult age groups to take the shot. Senior citizens and those with comorbidities getting shots from March 1 at 20,000 private vaccination centres with a reported price cap of Rs 400, is a huge leap for the vaccination campaign. For instance, if a private facility can vaccinate beyond 100 beneficiaries a session – even 24,000 daily as health expert Devi Shetty suggested – free them to do so. India’s vaccination strategy is making a welcome shift with greater choice and more private sector participation. After 40 days, against a target of 3 crore healthcare and frontline workers, only 1.23 crore vaccine doses could be dispensed to this target group. The challenge now is to ensure that the addition of new beneficiary categories and vaccination sites will boost capacity utilisation.%s
It’s a thankless task doing fine-grained analysis of over 2,000 castes to slice and dice the Central OBC list to provide for equitable distribution of benefits. In October 2017, a commission was set up by the government under former Delhi high court chief justice G Rohini to work out a ‘scientific’ method to subcategorise the Central list of OBCs who benefit from reservation of jobs and in educational institutions. People are trapped in narrow group identities, with fresh reservation demands representing benefits for one group at the expense of another. It’s an endless zero sum game, like a cat chasing its own tail; the very obverse of ‘sabka saath, sabka vikas’. The tendency to slice and dice is a reflex emanating from India’s poor record in providing quality education to all children and inadequate vibrancy in the economy.%s
Supreme Court’s observation in the bail hearing of DHFL promoters Kapil and Dheeraj Wadhwan – that agencies are satisfied with keeping people behind bars “for some days” instead of fast trial and conviction – also points to warped priorities. As Justice Chandrachud observed while granting Arnab Goswami interim bail in Mumbai police’s abetment to suicide probe: “Liberty survives by the vigilance of her citizens, on the cacophony of the media and in the dusty corridors of courts alive to the rule of (and not by) law.” Judge Rana’s concern over further restricting Disha’s liberty “on the basis of propitious anticipations” speaks to recent cases of prolonged incarceration on tenuous grounds. A reputed US digital forensics firm’s report of incriminating documents allegedly planted through malware to implicate accused persons in the Elgar Parishad case calls for speedy trial, or alternatively bail. The Delhi session’s court order granting bail to climate activist Disha Ravi ends the trauma of jail for the 22-year-old. It struggled to present any evidence in court that could link Disha to the Republic Day violence or make a cogent case for saying that Disha’s actions were tantamount to inciting violence. Further, additional sessions judge Dharmender Rana’s 18-page order peppered with insightful observations also offers good reasons to junk sedition laws.%s
Concurrently, Congress received a drubbing at the polls, winning just 55 seats – down from 176 five years ago – and failing to even open its account in Surat. Sans clear direction from the top, Congress leaders and workers are left feeling listless, making them vulnerable to poaching, defections and resignations as recently seen in Puducherry – where the only Congress government in south India fell. Unless Congress can offer a strong leader at the top who can motivate the party, its base will continue to crumble – with BJP enjoying rich dividends and the crumbs going to regional outfits.%s
India’s grand old party is no longer seen as capable of taking on the BJP juggernaut with voices growing for regional outfits and non-traditional parties to take the opposition lead. Plus, AAP doesn’t have Congress’s minority appeasement baggage, an important factor in Gujarat’s political firmament. While BJP made a clean sweep of all the six municipal corporations, AAP making inroads in the saffron outfit’s bastion indicates a political churn.%s
The court noted both the “blemish free” antecedents of the 22-year-old young woman and that PJF was not a banned organisation, nor was any criminal action pending against its founders. has now got bail, the larger picture is that citizens will continue to be accused of sedition on flimsy grounds and deprived of their liberty. Dharmender Rana said that not even an iota of evidence had been brought to his notice connecting the perpetrators of the violence on January 26 with the accused or with the Poetic Justice Foundation.%s
A twin-track system where government offers free vaccination to priority groups while the private sector focusses on speed and scale with freedom in pricing and walk-in enrolment for all adult age groups will yield optimum results. The glitches dogging the app weeks after rollout, even contributing to delays in vaccination and inconvenience to those arriving at vaccination sites for their shots, are likely to get worse amid plans for a fivefold scale up to 50,000 daily sessions. Sites must mandatorily share vaccination data with health authorities on a daily basis by aggregating the in-situ data collected, which hardly requires a centralised app with an onerous pre-registration requirement. It’s worth recalling the pandemic’s early months when mass testing was severely curtailed by excessive regulation that mandated only symptomatic testing and even doctor’s prescriptions for testing. With India on the cusp of a major change in vaccination strategy, government must heed public health experts, including members of its Covid-19 task force, calling for walk-in enrolments instead of pre-registration on the Co-WIN app.%s
Taxes are the primary reason for the record highs in the retail price of petrol and diesel, which have already breached the Rs 100 per litre mark in some parts of India. When crude price dropped from 2015, the government increased taxes to corner the benefits of a favourable environment. A week ago, the retail price of petrol in Delhi was Rs 89.29 a litre. The Centre’s tax is higher than base price of petrol. Of this, Rs 57.19, or 64% of the price, was on account of taxes and dealer commissions.%s
Knowing that Beijing will continue to turn up the heat whenever it wants to achieve strategic objectives and dial back to prevent war, India has to keep fast-tracking ties with the US and other Western nations to counter Beijing’s designs. China has backed India to host the Brics summit this year saying it is willing to work with India and other member states to strengthen cooperation. Beijing has thrown another crumb: Chinese President Xi Jinping is expected to visit India in the second half of the year for the summit if the Covid situation improves. It looks now as if having heightened border tensions over the last nine months, resulting in an intense LAC standoff and deaths of soldiers on both sides, Beijing is now looking for a thaw.%s
As the pygmification of India’s biggest opposition party continues apace, it is non-party actors, such as Punjab farmers today, who will step into the vacuum to voice social and political grievances. The way in which BJP is going to town with jibes about Rahul Gandhi’s “Midas touch” as the latter had visited Puducherry recently, underlines that the developments in Puducherry have been ‘engineered’ with an eye much beyond the small Union Territory. It was the vote of the nominated MLAs that was critical to V Naryanasamy’s government losing the trust vote on Monday, alongside the resignation of one DMK and five Congress MLAs in the runup to it.%s
Trusting the private healthcare sector in boosting vaccination – to tackle the most critical problem facing India today – will translate such talk into practice instantly. Five weeks after commencement of the vaccination drive, it has become fairly obvious that further delay in utilising private sector capacity can impose immense costs. However, leading lights of India’s private sector like Devi Shetty and Azim Premji have proposed a far more ambitious programme of vaccinating 50 crore people in 30 to 60 days. While government can continue its free vaccination drive for priority groups, the private sector must be freed from such bureaucratic exercises. If this is the onset of a second wave, the best countermeasure available – vaccination – must be scaled up immediately. After the Union Budget pushed a strong privatisation agenda, Prime Minister Narendra Modi made spirited arguments indicating how the private sector can act as a force multiplier in solving national problems.%s
Inspired by the philosophy of “self-sovereign identity” cryptocurrencies are an asset which are not anyone’s liability; neither is there a single authority or institution to maintain records. FATF, the inter-government body that sets standards to combat money laundering and terror financing, worries about this instrument becoming a safe haven for illegal deals. Its essential features are the credibility that comes from being guaranteed by the state, which leads to a central record keeper like RBI. They open the door to peer-to-peer transactions that circumvent state controls. What we have are digital currencies designed for decentralised operations, cutting out a regulated intermediary like a bank. A cryptocurrency like Bitcoin is also traded on exchanges, including in India, taking on the role of an asset.%s
foremost philanthropist Azim Premji joined other industry leaders and industry bodies like CII, to pitch for the government to engage the private sector, whose proactive participation can really give sorely needed pace to India’s vaccination drive. This dangerously tepid pace of vaccination is specially inexplicable in a country where availability of vaccines is not an issue, thanks to its intrepid private sector. Judged against the goal of vaccinating 300 million people with two doses by July, only around 10 million vaccinated as on February 20 is very worrying.%s
Australia’s Scott Morrison discussed with Narendra Modi a legislative bill being considered there: News Media and Digital Platforms Mandatory Bargaining Code, which aims to correct the power asymmetry between companies such as Google and Facebook, and news media. The process culminated in the legislative effort to force digital platforms to enter into contracts to share revenue with news platforms. In December 2017, the Australian government asked its competition commission to conduct an inquiry into digital platforms with special focus on news and journalism. Australia is intervening to restore balance between digital and news platforms, which is indeed the right way forward. The inquiry concluded that digital platforms are not the “dumb pipes” they profess to be. But the way in which Facebook abruptly blocked news on its site in Australia, impacting emergency services as well, underlines how ruthlessly  Big Tech will resist change. A conversation last week between the prime ministers of India and Australia encapsulated a far-reaching development in the regulation of technology and social media companies.%s
But quite apart from the penchant of mother tongue pushing policymakers to send their own children to English medium schools, there are many couples who do not share the same language, and many more who speak different dialects. Psychologist Daniel Kahneman has posited two general systems of thinking, in which the more effortful one is better at higher reasoning, and research has shown that it is this “slow thinking” that is activated by speaking a foreign language. Parents today are making widely varying language choices for their children, depending upon their different circumstances and desires. Growing millions of parents are also migrants, and they have excellent grounds for schooling their children in the language of a larger belonging and upward mobility, which is usually English in our country.%s
After all by allowing political violence to continue the state’s political parties limit institutional functioning and keep intact their unofficial channels of patronage. The state government has now formed a multi-agency SIT to probe the incident, even as chief minister Mamata Banerjee held Railways responsible and alleged a conspiracy comparable to the assassination of then Punjab CM Beant Singh in 1995.Bengal has a history of political violence which tellingly peaks around election time. Most fearfully, the bomb attack on Hossain reminds how wildly the fire of political violence has raged in this state as well as others in the past. Socially a curious paradox exists between Bengal’s so-called bhadralok culture that most state leaders espouse and the hooliganism that underpins their political ambitions.%s
Hashimoto, as a former athlete and minister who focussed on gender equality, is seen as a vindication for those who criticised Mori for saying that women hold up meetings, ‘annoyingly’ competing with each other by talking too much. A generational divide is evident in the outcry over Mori’s remark, with stubborn old people commonly being cast as ‘rougai’ on social media. His remarks betray the casual contempt with which generations of patriarchs have preferred women to remain subservient and barely audible. Withdrawing my remarks was the fastest way,” he said, given how the event was merely months away.%s
Given how the lockdown strategy failed to contain cases to areas where surges were detected, the state government should instead train its focus on testing and vaccination capacity in these places.%s
The verdict’s succinct yet powerful recognition of her act of “self-defence” and its empathy towards late complainants – invoked insensitively to detract victims without recognising their difficulty of coping with the trauma of sexual harassment or violence – may well become another clarion call moment like the 2017-18 #MeToo movement. The woman has a right to put her grievance at any platform of her choice and even after decades,” the court said, directly answering those who questioned women coming out with their #MeToo accounts after considerable passage of time, and those who questioned their choice of social media platforms rather than law enforcement mechanisms to air grievances. Since 2013, India has the Sexual Harassment at Workplaces (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act placing statutory responsibilities upon employers and a clearly defined penal provision criminalising sexual harassment (IPC Section 354A).Yet, it is still a long, lonely path for women because the harasser is almost always a senior in the organisation, enjoying great power and influence.%s
The polls likely reflect Punjab’s prevailing farm sentiment and attitude towards the Centre’s three new farm laws, with thousands of Punjabi farmers continuing to protest against them at Delhi’s borders. While BJP won just 50 wards – down from 248 in 2015 – SAD won 281 fewer than the 870 wards it won last time. The civic poll’s outcome certainly boosts Amarinder’s case to head Congress in upcoming assembly elections. In fact, Congress’s victory particularly in Pathankot, Hoshiarpur and Bathinda – Bathinda will get a Congress mayor for the first time in 53 years – is a big blow for Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and BJP that were perceived to be strong in these areas.%s
Also read: Congress sweeps municipal corporation polls in PunjabThe Punjab results have gained attention in the wake of the farm agitation that originated from the state. While the Punjab result per se won’t worry the BJP too much given its minimal stakes in the state, the spread of the farm fire to Haryana and now Western Uttar Pradesh, both strongholds of BJP, is another matter.%s
India’s inability to unlock with greater confidence, evident in Maharashtra’s lockdown threat, is exacerbated by the slow vaccination. Confirmation that the South African and Brazilian mutations of the novel coronavirus have entered India, coupled with discernible laxity in social distancing measures and slow pace of vaccination, pose threats to the gains made since October in the anti-Covid fight. Allowing the private market comprising private hospitals and clinics – which account for nearly two-third of patient footfalls – to start vaccinating on demand is the easiest way to scale up. Bharat Biotech’s quick release of a preprint research paper on Covaxin’s efficacy against the UK coronavirus variant is worth following. If the Co-WIN app, which again witnessed glitches during the second dosing, has limitations in facilitating such a mass vaccination process, decentralised models of data entry and analysis must be pursued. Government and its health experts must expend greater efforts to tackle misinformation, doubts about vaccine safety, and their efficacy against mutations.%s
But the French competition watchdog ruled Google’s move an abuse of market dominance and the internet giant was forced to reach an agreement with news publishers to pay them for news content. Canberra is pressing ahead with its News Media Bargaining Code that would make internet giants Google and Facebook pay for news content. In fact, the Australian government announced that it would amend the draft law after its ministers held discussions with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Google’s chief executive Sundar Pichai so that publishers would be paid lump sums rather than per click on news articles. In France, Google stopped displaying news content after that country adopted the 2019 EU copyright rules that allow press publications to secure royalties from online platforms.%s
Efforts to reconfigure Covishield, India’s current vaccine mainstay, to meet the challenges posed by these two variants must begin immediately given trials noting the low efficacy of vaccines against the South African variant. In this context the delay in taking the vaccine to the private market, given India’s excess supply, is surprising. Their high contagiousness and potential to cause re-infections and beat antibodies produced by vaccinations is a cause for worry.%s
India’s mapping policies and geospatial regulations have been carrying the burden of 19th century realities when maps had high strategic value that justified secrecy. Therefore, restricted geospatial data will now be freely available for companies to create value added products. Most of us unthinkingly use location-based, or geospatial data, while navigating roads or ordering a delivery service that uses it. The current change should be viewed as part of a larger push to help the economy benefit from India’s early public investment in space technology. This basic data, which is used as an input across industries, is sourced from overseas companies that produce location maps and sell their services over the internet. Existing restrictions on use of geospatial data will be junked to encourage domestic industry. The government deserves credit for changing its approach to geospatial data.%s
Meanwhile, against 1,876 cases pending trial from previous years and 485 cases sent for trial in 2019, courts completed trial in just 113 cases, with a 29% conviction rate. Its unique provisions forbidding judges from granting bail where the case diary/ chargesheet show “reasonable grounds for believing” the accusations as “prima facie true” deny accused persons the usual grounds for bail. At 2019’s start, 3,908 UAPA cases were pending investigation from previous years in which police filed 257 chargesheets in 2019. SC must also take note of sedition cases spiking year-on-year from 35 in 2016 to 70 in 2018 and 93 in 2019.%s
Govt makes fresh bid to rein in pesky callers, phone fraudsOn top of this there is today easy access to personal data, which makes it simple for telemarketers to commit financial fraud on gullible consumers, especially the elderly. Cracking down on such unwelcome calls, which are a source of great irritation to telecom subscribers, comes after earlier attempts like setting up the Do Not Disturb registry have been bypassed by telemarketers. A data protection law to prevent the leakage of consumer telecom and financial information in the possession of telecom and banking companies is also necessary.%s
Delhi police’s arrest of young climate activist Disha Ravi on multiple charges like sedition, criminal conspiracy and promoting enmity between groups – alleging her involvement in a farm agitation toolkit publicised by Greta Thunberg – appears disproportionate. The police action, if intended to quell the domestic and international left-wing support that the farm agitation has evoked, is having the opposite effect of alienating more domestic constituencies like farmers and youth. Disha’s hush-hush arrest with no clarity on whether a transit remand from a Bengaluru court was obtained and the remand hearing in Delhi where she was represented by a legal aid counsel rather than a lawyer of her choice lead to questions on whether her constitutional rights were prejudiced. The police’s task is to gauge if the yardsticks for invoking sedition like incitement to imminent violence can be applied against a ragtag bunch of activists led by Disha.%s
This weekend, one week after a massive surge of water trapped over 30 persons inside a 1.6km head race tunnel at the Tapovan hydropower plant, rescue teams were finally able to enter 125m inside it. The previous Sunday Chamoli had seen not only a massive cascade of water and silt leave over 150 persons missing, but also the dramatic rescue of foreman Vijendra Kumar and his team. Another miracle had heavy motor vehicle driver Vipul Kaireni and around 25 others being saved because his mother, who had been working outdoors in a village higher up, called to warn that a swollen Dhauliganga was headed his way.%s
motherHowever, the toolkit at the centre of the case spreads basic information on the protests and suggests various online and offline protest modes but doesn’t incite violence, an essential ingredient for invoking the sedition charge. With doubts also being raised about the procedure followed in her arrest and remand to custody, the Supreme Court or Delhi high court must examine whether Disha’s legal rights were compromised.%s
His view of a “ramshackle” judiciary and that people going to court regret their decision does no credit to either the government or judges like him who have overseen the country’s judicial administration. Appointing more judges, streamlining civil and criminal procedures that are delaying case disposal, embracing technology, and ensuring greater synergy between courts, police, government departments and lawyers are a few necessary reforms. Judicial reforms remain caught in a limbo, amid decades of power struggle between government and Supreme Court over judicial appointments. While most judges strive to whittle down the backlog of years past, select SC and HC judges and bureaucrats must be delegated  at central and state levels to finalise judicial/ legal reforms and oversee implementation. National Judicial Data Grid reveals 3.8 crore pending cases in lower courts, with the last one year itself aggravating pendency burden by nearly 50 lakh cases.%s
The final vote was 57 guilty to 43 not guilty, short of the 67 guilty votes needed to convict Trump. Importantly, seven Republican senators joined their Democratic colleagues in finding Trump guilty, highlighting bipartisan consensus about the former president’s actions that led to the right-wing insurrection. There’s no denying that Trump put out a stream of falsehoods on losing the presidential polls, and openly urged his supporters to march to the US Congress. However, the Senate vote means that despite being impeached twice, Trump can technically still come back and contest the 2024 presidential polls.%s
Therefore, when flying resumed two months later with restrictions, the government stepped in to help by fixing different price bands depending on the duration of flights. Yet, almost nine months after domestic aviation resumed, the government has decided to continue with price bands. Therefore, direct government intervention in a market economy through restrictions on price movement is a gross distortion. The price bands are seen to be helping out companies with weak financials, but they bring no efficiency gains and are at the cost of the consumer. Withdraw the price bands in aviation and let market competition take its course.%s
A Punjab man who had sexual relations with an Australia-based woman but later broke his promise of marriage prompting the woman to file a rape case highlights a grey area in the law. The relationship – from love, rape charges and bail through to marital bliss – swings between extremes like a B grade melodrama. Rejected anticipatory bail by high court, the man agreed to marriage and secured conditional bail from Supreme Court, provided he didn’t renege on his promise a second time.%s
First, the return of Virat Kohli to the test team strengthened the batting but his leadership gives the team an unsettled feel. These are some issues that need to be sorted out soon or India’s performance may take a big dip during the generational transition that will happen sooner than later. It is strange that Kuldeep Yadav is good enough to make the squad as a spinner but doesn’t inspire enough confidence in the captain to be played in the final 11. Therefore, we are likely to see a fairly big change in first choice players in test matches by next year.%s
Defence minister Rajnath Singh informed the Rajya Sabha yesterday that sustained talks had seen the two sides reach an agreement for disengagement on the north and south banks of Pangong, with the Chinese side withdrawing its troops to their positions east of Finger 8 and Indian soldiers pulling back to their Dhan Singh Thapa post between Finger 2 and 3. In signs of a breakthrough in the nine month long India-China border standoff, both sides have kicked off initial disengagement in eastern Ladakh’s Pangong Tso area by pulling back some tanks, howitzers and armoured vehicles. That said, the entire process of sequential disengagement, de-escalation and de-induction will take time with the progress being monitored and verified at every stage. Even if the current round of disengagement from friction points goes off well, we don’t know that Beijing will de-mobilise the 50,000 troops it has deployed across the LAC.%s
At a time when farmers’ protests have put it on the back foot, it’s welcome that the Modi government has doubled down on the reform agenda in the Budget instead of succumbing to populist pressure. privatisation’ suggests that it may be moving out of the ‘reform by stealth’ mode into acknowledging more frontally what the economy needs to climb out of the hole it’s currently in. The subtext of charges like ‘suit boot ki sarkar’ is that ‘dhoti kurta sarkar’ would be better. But experts have long noted that the NDA government with its historic majority and Modi with his enormous political capital, can break this impasse with candid advocacy of reforms. Every time a government attempts them, an opposition party takes up the faux mantle of aam admi.%s
Vibrant competition in all sectors will do a lot to quell a lot of misgivings about the private sector. When in government, there is rarely a coherent effort to build a regulatory apparatus that will foster adequate competition. He articulated his views on the subject while defending the government’s budget initiative to go ahead with its privatisation programme. Prime Minister Narendra Modi yesterday put matters in the right perspective when he wanted an end to the demonisation of the private sector.%s
For example, Taiwan’s TSMC – the world’s largest contract chip manufacturer – is the product of the Taiwanese government’s concerted efforts at semiconductor manufacturing since the 1970s. China is a world leader in this sector, controlling over 80% of the world’s raw material refining, 77% of the world’s cell capacity, and 60% of the world’s component manufacturing. And if government identifies this as a priority strategic area and provides the right inputs – subsidies, land, power etc – India could emerge as an alternative hub for the global rechargeable battery supply chain. In fact, India has an opportunity here to leapfrog lithium-ion batteries – known to occasionally burst into flames – and invest in rechargeable aluminium batteries that charge faster and have a longer life. The recent global shortage of semiconductor chips – which has hit the automobile sector hard – shows how vital this industry is.%s
The dangerous take-no-prisoners approach that’s become fashionable in politics – one reason for its dominance these days is that populism demands seeing a political opponent as the enemy – must give way to more consensual approaches. In the months ahead, this spirit of political cooperation and his personal outreach will be crucial to resolving the farm agitation, smoothly disinvesting from non-strategic PSUs, and taking other critical steps forward for the country. But even a single party government cannot afford to brush aside the opposition as the impasse over farm reforms highlights. Such an approach can bring on board parties whose opposition isn’t ideological but driven more by extreme political polarisation.%s
Separately, data of a seroprevalence study was released in Tamil Nadu, a state which recorded a relatively high number of confirmed cases in the early days. Given the number of unknown aspects, the healthcare fraternity and all governments should work on persuading the population to shed its vaccine hesitancy. No Covid-19 death in Delhi after 9 monthsIt has raised the hope that large parts of India may be heading towards herd immunity, a stage that would diminish the threat of virus transmission significantly.%s
Gogoi had pushed the “grand alliance” that Congress is laboriously stitching together with Badruddin Ajmal’s AUDF, three Left parties and new outfit AGM. ”, Congress’s next-gen leaders are missing Gogoi’s reassuring hand. Amid Congress struggling to regroup and BJP’s 2016 allies AGP and BPF losing steam, the government enjoyed a smooth sailing, except during anti-NRC-CAA protests. Returning to voters, BJP’s performance will be compared with the three-term Tarun Gogoi government, credited with ushering stability into the strife torn state. In Telangana and Bihar, Congress’s “grand” alliances had sunk, bereft of chemistry. While Assam seems to have escaped the public health brunt of Covid, the economic fallout, especially for migrant workers who are a big denomination in the state, hasn’t become a talking point yet. Unlike BJP’s “double engine%s
After six years of toil, the negotiations were suspended due to “a gap in the level of ambition” between the two sides, according to the EU.A couple of months ago, foreign minister S Jaishankar said the EU still appears reluctant. In 2007, both sides tried to deepen trade ties through a comprehensive Free Trade Agreement. It was an outcome of the 15th India-EU Leaders’ Summit held last July, when both sides decided to look for ways to revive stalled trade talks. Both sides have a lot to gain by moving past these issues towards tighter economic integration. However, subsequent developments suggest that both sides have taken a practical approach towards a comprehensive FTA.%s
The main consequence of the bill is that it hurts farmers and will partially offset the benefits of the three central laws passed by Parliament in September which aim to provide more choice to farmers. None of the government’s assurances deal with the core problem which is that the bill hurts the economic interests of farmers. By restricting options for the disposal of an asset, the bill changes the economics of dairy farming, particularly for small farmers.%s
Following the recommendations of the Chopra committee, the Union environment ministry did accept the need for caution and careful study when it came to “deforestation/ tunnelling/  blasting/ reservoir formation” in zones in the higher Himalayan region that are naturally unstable. On Sunday Uttarakhand’s Chamoli district saw massive flooding sweep away the entirety of the Rishiganga hydropower project, alongside a significant chunk of the Tapovan project. A Supreme Court constituted high-powered committee has warned of “irreversible damage”.The fact is that simultaneous pursuit of environmental and economic goods in a democracy does involve complex calculations. The danger here is that instead of mitigating the climate challenge, ill-conceived projects could end up multiplying the risks – and for all of India that lives downstream of the Himalayan rivers. The Rishiganga project, for example, has seen allegations of “using explosives and blasting the mountains” flouting all norms. Above all, the many uncertainties spoke to how heavy duty infrastructural push in this ecologically sensitive region is taking place without rigorous enough local research.%s
India’s public sector banks have seen change in the last three years after the government tried to build scale through mergers, and also bring a wider geographical footprint under each bank. If the government’s aim is to restrict its presence to a bare minimum, it’s best to begin privatisation with sounder banks. It may be tempting to retain the better run and profitable public sector banks and try to sell the weakest. It’s been identified as a strategic sector where the government wants to retain a “minimum” presence. After three rounds of consolidation public sector banks have shrunk from 27 in March 2017 to 12 in April 2020.%s
It is the worst disaster Garhwal Himalayas have experienced since 2013.Simultaneously, geologists will start working out on the cause for the glacial lake outburst which triggered the floods which cost lives and damaged infrastructure. The first priority for the Uttarakhand government and the Centre is to rescue people who have been trapped by the fallout of the glacier breach in the state’s Chamoli district. Glaciers, which are rivers of ice, can break without an increase in temperature because of the pressure of ice that has piled up.%s
It requires a change in the nature of support from indirect subsidies to more direct ones like income support some states and the Centre provide through transfers into bank accounts. TN’s loan waiver works out to about Rs 73,706 per farmer, more than 12 times the Centre’s annual income support of Rs 6,000. Tamil Nadu chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami last week informed the state assembly that his government will waive Rs 12,110 crore of crop loan issued to 1.64 million farmers by cooperative banks. Instead of undermining the case for reforms in this fashion, indirect subsidies should be phased out, which is easy now because the mechanism for direct bank transfers is in place. A compelling case for central farm laws comes from the distortions that have arisen on account of the existing agricultural subsidy regime. One of the harmful distortions comes through government subsidies in the form of a loan waiver, such as the one promised by TN.%s
In fact BJP is leaving no stone unturned – from laying claim to the legacy of Netaji Subhas Bose to promising new infra projects and new jobs – to make the lotus bloom in Bengal. There are also apprehensions that inducting TMC members accused of corruption and extortion – charges BJP has been levelling against the Mamata Banerjee government – could prove a costly stain on the lotus. On the one hand this underlines that BJP has the tailwinds and has potentially solved its old problem of lacking charismatic Bengali faces – especially after former TMC ministers Suvendu Adhikari and Rajib Banerjee switched sides.%s
After three bail rejections by a magistrate, sessions court and high court, Supreme Court’s immediate readiness to free comedian Munawar Faruqui should by itself send a signal to all courts that “bail, not jail” should be the judiciary’s primary instinct. Police were directed to certify the necessity of arrests against a five-point checklist: possibility of committing another offence, proper investigation of present offence, preventing evidence from disappearing, threat to witnesses, and possibility of accused absconding. SC issuing notice to MP on Faruqui’s plea challenging the FIR engenders hope that abuse of Section 295A and in turn the onslaught on free speech can be dialled back. Without even scrutinising the violation of fundamental right to free speech, the apex court decided the other fundamental issue: Was arrest necessary? In contrast, Justices Nariman and Gavai cast Faruqui’s arrest against SC’s 2014 Arnesh Kumar judgment.%s
Diseases that specifically affect women are under-researched, and women are less commonly screened for common conditions like heart disease, or even mental illness. Women under-use health services because of lack of affordability, lack of transport, having less money and less time than men, and also most fundamentally, because the world is not set up to attend to their well-being. Women are also under-studied in clinical trials, which assume the male body as the standard, hampering the efficacy of drugs for women. Today, one in 22 urban women and one in 60 rural women is at risk of the disease.%s
Delivering the keynote address at the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) conclave, Defence minister Rajnath Singh said that India had a role to play in the peaceful and prosperous co-existence of all countries, and that it was ready to supply weapons to regional partners. Read – India ready to supply weapons to IOR countries: Rajnath Singh If India has decided to counter these Chinese designs by boosting defence ties with IOR neighbours, it is welcome. There’s no denying that in recent years Beijing has been trying to increase its footprint in the IOR, giving credence to its ‘String of Pearls’ strategy to surround India with a network of naval ports and bases.%s
Even as such cases grow, it is very clear that the outrage in question is highly arbitrary and subjective, and taken to its logical conclusion would silence all jokes and storytelling, leaving the ghost of freedom of expression rattling in a very lonely cage. Supreme Court grants interim bail to stand up comic Munawar FaruquiIt is in this context that both the arrest of Faruqui and then multiple denials of bail, are causes of high concern. Note that the Indore Superintendent of Police Vijay Khatri was even reported to suggest that lack of proof of Faruqui having voiced religious insults on January 1 didn’t matter  because he was going to voice them.%s
The government’s plan is to realise this goal through three concrete measures: create the necessary institutional structure, monetise assets and expand capital investment through budgets. Even as the monetisation of railway assets goes on, it’s important to simultaneously put in place a regulator to ensure smooth functioning. Key to the plan’s success is that of some ongoing monetisation projects, such as the redevelopment of key railway stations in Mumbai and Delhi which began last year. A highlight of finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s Budget speech was setting out the government’s intent to develop infrastructure. The only way to insulate asset monetisation programme is to create a transparent institutional mechanism. Successful monetisation requires the government to learn lessons from earlier experiences. This is a prerequisite in asset monetisation, as calibrating user charges requires transparency.%s
In July 2018, a five judge Supreme Court bench had delineated a rational division of powers recognising Centre’s prerogative over police, public order and land, while the Delhi government didn’t need to obtain LG’s “concurrence” on every issue of day to day governance. It reportedly requires the city government to send legislative proposals for the LG’s opinion 15 days in advance and administrative proposals seven days ahead. But Delhi police’s recurring failures under Union home ministry supervision without city government oversight question such rationale. Governance could again hit a standstill; the LG’s lack of accountability to Delhi’s electorate is reason enough to proceed slowly.%s
While it remains to be seen if this softening of tone will actually lead to concrete action on Pakistan’s part, Bajwa’s remark could also be indicative of the intense pressure that he and Prime Minister Imran Khan are facing from an alliance of Pakistani opposition parties. In a surprising change in tone, Pakistan army chief General Qamar Bajwa remarked that it was time to extend a hand of peace in all directions and that India and Pakistan must resolve the Kashmir issue in a dignified and peaceful manner as per the aspirations of the Kashmiri people. Hence, for Pakistan’s own sake and for peace in South Asia, Islamabad must genuinely dismantle its terror factories and sincerely pursue measures to repair ties with India. The truth is that backing terrorists only helps the Pakistani military retain power and project itself as Pakistan’s sole security guarantor.%s
On Day 1 of the ongoing National Polio Immunisation Drive, 89 lakh children were administered oral drops involving 12 lakh vaccinators and 1.8 lakh supervisors. Vaccinating the 30 crore priority group of health and frontline workers, senior citizens, and those with comorbidities by July with 60 crore doses requires 33 lakh daily inoculations. The serosurvey indicating 56% of Delhiites – over 1 crore people – with antibodies raises questions about containment measures like masking, testing, tracing and lockdowns. With middling turnout at many vaccination sites, opening vaccination to the general public resolves unutilised capacity. NSO 2017-18 data indicates that just 30% of patients go to government facilities for treatments against 40% to private doctors/ clinics and 23% to private hospitals. On Monday and Tuesday, the number of daily inoculations hovered near 2 lakh after consecutive peaks of 5 lakh last Thursday and Friday. Otherwise new mutations, some of which reportedly dodge the antibodies produced by prior infection and vaccination, could pose fresh problems.%s
Like the Rihanna song goes, “You can stand under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh,” the idol promises. But all credit also to our resident ‘revolver rani’, Kangana Ranaut, who amplified the original tweet with lots of figmental and smutty compost, including the sensational claim that the protests are a plot to make India “a Chinese colony much like USA. After all, candy crush is nothing to celebrity crush, by which you now carve your likes, dislikes, selfies, shelfies, bedrooms, bathrooms, really the list is unending. If she pays attention to this cockeyed theory, the chilled Barbadian would likely dismiss it with a grin, “Love the way you lie. It’s where you go to put yourself “four, five seconds from wildin.” There is reductiveness on the other side too, although nowhere near as foul and vomitty, where the popstar has been overnight elevated into Khaleesi, dragon mother safeguarding India’s farmers.%s
Responding to a question on the Chinese intrusions into Indian territory, Emily J Horne, spokesperson of the White House’s National Security Council, asserted that the US will stand with friends, partners and allies to advance shared prosperity, security and values in the Indo-Pacific region. This is a clear signal that the Biden administration will continue with the previous Trump administration’s efforts to counter China’s aggressive tactics in Asia. Biden admin slams China, stands by IndiaBut if Biden can combine both regional economic measures and security posturing, it could lead to a powerful strategy to counter China’s expansionist designs.%s
At a time when the country is facing an unprecedented economic crisis triggered by an unprecedented health crisis, bulldozing tactics on government side and stonewalling on opposition side serve India extremely ill. The farm reforms laws, which represent reforms that several opposition parties have actually supported in the past, were passed in Parliament with a bypassing of due process that has borne disharmony and needlessly discredited the laws’ intent. In a positive development the time set aside for discussion on the Motion of Thanks to the President’s address in Rajya Sabha has been increased by 5 hours to 15 hours, so that it can be used to debate the farmers’ protests and associated matters.%s
But it’s clear that the army was never fully onboard the democratic project, and had hoped for a managed democratic setup whereby it retained significant control. In a sudden turn of events, the army in Myanmar mounted a coup in the early hours of Monday to seize power from the democratically elected government, whose de facto leader was Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi. Two successive national elections with growing margins of victory for Suu Kyi and NLD rang alarm bells for the generals – who may have thought the country was inexorably drifting towards democracy in a manner they couldn’t manage. Myanmar had been taking baby steps towards a democratic polity since 2011, and the army coup is an enormous setback. Meanwhile, Suu Kyi had collaborated with the army all this while – even making controversial statements about the Rohingya crisis – perhaps with the hope of reforming Myanmar from within.%s
Government and opposition aren’t budging an inch from their respective positions when the farm bills were passed in the monsoon session, without accepting the latter’s demand to refer it to a select committee. With the government’s offer to suspend the laws for 18 months not proving adequate to bring agitating farmers around, it’s only fitting that the impasse is debated in Parliament which enacted the laws. It reflects in the sedition cases slapped upon government critics and journalists by BJP-governed states or the opposition’s surly equating of much-needed privatisation to selling the family silver and crony capitalism. Disruptions in both Houses of Parliament yesterday – following the opposition clamour for repeal of the farm laws – portend another stormy session.%s
But on the very day the new Myanmar Parliament was to convene for its first session, the army, which since giving up absolute power in 2011 has pursued a “discipline-flourishing democracy”, detained Suu Kyi and other democratically elected leaders of her party, imposed a state of emergency, and handed power to the armed forces’ commander-in-chief General Min Aung Hlaing. India has said “the rule of law and the democractic process must be upheld.”Explained: Myanmar’s return to military ruleIt is not, however, clear what kind of international actions can help Myanmar democracy at this point. US President Joe Biden has called it “a direct assault on the country’s transition to democracy and the rule of law.%s
The total expenditure for 2021-22 is expected to be Rs 34.83 lakh crore, marginally higher than the Rs 34.50 lakh crore that the FM said will be spent in the current financial year after the stimulus packages. The other highlight of the spending programme is that the government plans to enhance budgetary support for capital expenditure in 2021-22 to Rs 5.54 lakh crore, higher by 26.19% over the revised expenditure for the current year. The highlight however is the expected growth in disinvestment proceeds to Rs 1.75 lakh crore from the Rs 32,000 crore expected this year. Fiscal deficit for the current financial year is expected to be 9.5% of GDP, which the government aims to lower to 6.8% in 2021-22. The most significant change is the switch back to a development financial institution model backed by Rs 20,000 crore as government equity to catalyse infrastructure funding. On the revenue side, tax receipts are expected to bounce back in 2021-22 as the nominal GDP is forecast to grow 14.4% to Rs 222.87 lakh crore. The highlight of next year’s spending will be a sharp 43% reduction in subsidies to Rs 3.69 lakh crore. Budget details signal that the government expects to move out of crisis mode the next financial year by reallocating expenditure from emergency measures such as food relief to other priorities. Designed in the backdrop of a pandemic induced contraction in national economic output, it marks a discernible shift towards experimenting with measures to boost economic growth through a push to build infrastructure. The Budget pins its hopes on the government attracting private finance in areas such as public bus transport services and the 8,500 km of road projects to be awarded in 2021-22. The Budget’s financial sector changes are linked to its aspirations on infrastructure development.%s
Accordingly finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman not only announced specific projects such as highway infrastructure targets for the poll bound states of Assam, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal, and a sharp increase in capital expenditure at Rs 5.54 lakh crore from Rs 4.39 lakh crore, but also a Rs 20,000 crore capital outlay for a professionally managed Development Finance Institution. Critical infra projects are capital intensive but the economic slowdown has multiplied private capital’s hesitations, which is why the government is setting up such a public institution once again, to act as an enabler and catalyst for long-term and much larger infra financing. Well executed projects have the potential to prove transformational in the post Covid era, particularly as the infrastructure deficit from transportation to power has hobbled India’s manufacturing competitiveness and overall growth.%s
The new Information Technology rules notified by the government give unprecedented powers to the executive to summarily take down content from digital news media platforms on vague grounds, and without so much as giving the publisher a hearing. The move has shocked the entire news media fraternity which had presumed the new regulations would cover mainly social media platforms and entertainment segments like OTT players who have been in a dialogue with the government for some time now. All news media will be affected by the emergency powers to take news content down without giving publishers a hearing. Industry players are describing this as the government’s way of “regulating self-regulation”.While regulation of these other segments was being contemplated, the news media segment never expected it would get clubbed within the same regulatory regime. Worse, the new rules give emergency powers to the secretary, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting to censor digital news content without consulting the publisher. And this is being done in the name of regulating all internet-based media platforms across the board – including news, entertainment, OTT Apps like Netflix, Hotstar and big social platforms like Facebook, Twitter etc. The government has disingenuously extended the Information Technology Act 2000, which governs online platform accountability, to control digital news content through the backdoor,  without subjecting it to legislative discussion. Legal experts opine that putting online news content in the same basket as those governed under the IT Act is ultra vires the act  and a clear violation of free speech guaranteed under Article 19(1)(a)of the constitution.%s
Since a constitution is only as good as the guarantee of its enforceability, it is a matter of great misfortune that this year’s ‘celebration’ comes amidst a worrying debate over whether one of keys to the constitution’s enforcement – Article 32 – may be getting diluted. If judges now start believing – as Chief Justice S.A. Bobde said during the bail hearing of journalist Siddique Kappan – that the ordinary citizen’s recourse to Article 32 needs to be “discouraged’, they might as well sign the death warrant for the constitution’s soul. India’s Temple Is its Secular ConstitutionSome commentators have described the possible dilution of the “basic structure doctrine” as the advent of “judicial barbarism” which has followed what large sections of the citizenry have experienced in terms of the hijacking of their basic democratic rights over the past six years. Whether it is the government’s authoritarian approach to Kashmir, the passage of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, the blatantly partisan investigation of the Delhi riots, the continued incarceration without bail of intellectuals and activists in the fraudulent Bhima Koregaon case and more recently the arrest and harassment of journalists, November 26, 2020 is is actually a day for mourning Samvidhan Divas, not celebrating it. It is also about the erosion of the cumulative achievement via decades of a progressive jurisprudence centred around the “basic structure doctrine” as outlined by The Wire’s legal editor V.Venkatesan in a series of important articles. This is the biggest question people need to ponder over on Samvidhan Divas 2020.Finally, this Constitution Day, let us specially remember all the prisoners of conscience who are in jail with no recourse to bail – from the octogenarians Stan Swamy and Varavara Rao to the young students being framed for the Delhi riots and all the women and men in between. The Right to Dissent is the Most Important Right Granted by the Constitution: Justice GuptaThe real disappointment for citizens facing such an unprecedented assault on their basic democratic rights is not that the Modi regime and its hatchet men are behaving the way they are.%s
The steady stream of half-baked ‘evidence’ flowing from the official investigation into those news channels which are leading the charge seems aimed at keeping a particular narrative going; the extent to which ignorant investigators and moronic media are working in tandem became clear when a text message from Rhea Chakraborty with the millennial phrase ‘Imma bounce’ (translation; ‘I’m leaving’) became a sensational news break on Times Now – a news channel owned by India’s biggest media house – about how the young woman was conspiring to bounce a cheque!Also read: The Curious Case of the Bihar Top Cop in the Limelight In TV’s rush to drown viewers in diversionary noise, Chakraborty stands a condemned woman, with all manner of accusations hurled at her – a manipulating girlfriend who stole money from her partner Sushant Singh Rajput, was on drugs and perhaps abetted or at least conspired to have him killed. On nightly television news – whose anchors serve as judge, jury and executioner in all matters – she has been vilified beyond all known limits of journalistic ethics, to say nothing of human decency. All of these wild charges are based on a deadly cocktail of innuendo, constant vilification on social media and unending sensational coverage of what was initially thought to be a simple case of death by suicide. Also read: Rhea Chakraborty’s Trial by Media Reflects Entrenched MisogynyWhatever dubious information this process has produced has been presented to the public as hard fact, without a shred of evidence.

BluffOther examples include withholding data, thus denying journalists and experts the ability to check results in the full context in which they are to be understood; distorting or miscommunicating data, as is often the case with the infection fatality rate; removing data, such as by taking down documents containing information about the number of individuals tested by date before April 24; denying others’ claims but with insufficient data, thus adding to the confusion, as with the preprint paper that claimed India’s epidemic would peak in November; and publicising some findings by leaking them to the press. As a result, until the paper becomes available, ICMR stands guilty of the same charge that Patanjali Ayurved has been accused of: doing science by press release, i.e. to expose one’s results to non-expert people before it has been vetted by other experts. This is unacceptable because ICMR is not just India’s council for medical research but the principal fount of scientific knowledge vis-à-vis India’s COVID-19 epidemic. For example, on June 8, three days before the press conference, the New Indian Express reported that the seroprevalence survey had found that “as high as one-third of the population in many containment areas in hotspot cities may have already been infected by the virus and quietly recovered”. More than a month after Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) researchers conducted an important seroprevalence survey, a published paper with the methods and results is nowhere in sight. Perhaps the most egregious example is ICMR’s inexplicable love affair with hydroxychloroquine, in which the body made some decisions that flew so directly in the face of evidence and ethics that it was hard to believe a well-reasoned rebuttal would be taken seriously. The last point is particularly dangerous because it allows ICMR researchers to get the results of their studies into the public domain but without opening up the body to be questioned on their validity or, for that matter, to be seen as questioning any official policy. While publishing delays are not implicitly wrong, even during a pandemic – it is better to take the time and publish a good paper than to publish a bad paper in a hurry –%s
As we had said in an editorial note five years ago, we wanted to “reimagine the media as a joint venture in the public sphere between journalists, readers and a concerned citizenry. But as our readers and viewers will testify, the bet we took on the main advantage of being non-profit – that it would help our journalism remain fiercely independent – has proved a winning one. In the aftermath of the lockdown, people who rarely get space in the ‘mainstream’ media – despite constituting the national mainstream – have forced their way into our consciousness. There is also a growing cadre of freelance journalists in every part of the country who pursue stories in the public interest and who help ensure the wilful silence of the Big Media is broken. But even as digital media has flourished, offering a wide variety of choices to a readership that virtually lives online, the same cannot be said for the news industry as a whole, or for journalism as a craft. But digital journalism in India is barely older than half a decade and has, in this short period, faced many challenges – from rapid changes in technology to revenue constraints and official hostility. But India still has newspapers, TV channels and websites willing to fight the good fight, and a large number of journalists – The Wire’s mission is to bring public interest journalism to its readers and viewers and we know you will continue to support us. In a media landscape where some newspapers have a history going back nearly 200 years, a fifth anniversary may appear inconsequential. Across India, journalists have risen to the occasion and told their stories, even while some media houses have tried to ridicule them. Many well-known newspapers and television channels have become glorified gazettes for the government, highlighting its claims and reserving their criticism for its opponents.%s
The images flooding television screens for the past few nights, along with reports by journalists from numerous organisations who had all been subject to the mob’s vicious attacks, brought back stark memories of 1984 – the last time Delhi was in the throes of such organised communal violence – or 2002, when the state of Gujarat under Narendra Modi burned for weeks. Apart from Kapil Mishra, party legislators and functionaries have either openly inciting anti-Muslim hatred or helped demonise the anti-CAA protests – which have all been peaceful – as anti-national. The utter chaos and lawlessness which reigned unchecked on the watch of the Narendra Modi government at the Centre – which controls law and order in the national capital – has left at least 21 people dead, including a policeman, and several hundred injured. While Union home minister Amit Shah has been missing in action, the junior home minister has now set his sights on the media – demanding action against news platforms whose reports of the violence have proved embarrassing for the government. But there are also deeper underlying factors – institutional and political – which helped push Delhi into the abyss. Ordinary working people – both Hindus and Muslims – have died in the orchestrated mayhem. ’s polarising politics around the question of citizenship – can expect no succour from such partisan law enforcers. Given the nature of the mobs and their leaders, the violence quickly lost any pretence of a ‘political’ motive and descended into crude, generalised communal violence against Muslims.%s
And of course social media is awash with fake memes, pumped up nationalism, and the naming and shaming of all those ‘enemies of the nation’ – from leftist students to liberals to the much-reviled ‘prestitutes’ – for not succumbing to the jingoist fervour. With Lok Sabha elections around the corner, every effort is being made to get the voter to think that the nation needs to unite behind one man – a decisive leader who can give a fitting reply to those who threaten the country. A narrative has been spun in the aftermath of the suicide bomb attack that killed 44 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) soldiers in Pulwama that it is somehow unpatriotic to ask questions about the role that intelligence and policy failures might have played. From demanding that Kashmiri students be thrown out of their institutions to asking landlords to not keep Kashmiri tenants, there is a concerted attempt underway to corner people from the state. In Punjab, the Bharatiya Janata Party and its supporters have gone after Navjot Singh Siddhu for his statement that an entire country – Pakistan – could not be blamed for the actions of a few. It is possible to express sorrow at the death of soldiers and condemn terrorism from across the border while at the same time asking legitimate questions about intelligence failure. Indians are angry at the killing of the jawans but let us be clear about one thing: anyone who tries to turn this anger into violence against fellow citizens is essentially doing the dirty work of the Jaish-e-Mohammad for them. In Ahmedabad, there are demands from hyper-patriots that people boycott Gujarat Samachar, a leading daily, for a critical headline implying the terrorists had been emboldened under Narendra Modi’s government.%s
The new Information Technology rules notified by the government give unprecedented powers to the executive to summarily take down content from digital news media platforms on vague grounds, and without so much as giving the publisher a hearing. The move has shocked the entire news media fraternity which had presumed the new regulations would cover mainly social media platforms and entertainment segments like OTT players who have been in a dialogue with the government for some time now. All news media will be affected by the emergency powers to take news content down without giving publishers a hearing. Industry players are describing this as the government’s way of “regulating self-regulation”.While regulation of these other segments was being contemplated, the news media segment never expected it would get clubbed within the same regulatory regime. Worse, the new rules give emergency powers to the secretary, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting to censor digital news content without consulting the publisher. And this is being done in the name of regulating all internet-based media platforms across the board – including news, entertainment, OTT Apps like Netflix, Hotstar and big social platforms like Facebook, Twitter etc. The government has disingenuously extended the Information Technology Act 2000, which governs online platform accountability, to control digital news content through the backdoor,  without subjecting it to legislative discussion. Legal experts opine that putting online news content in the same basket as those governed under the IT Act is ultra vires the act  and a clear violation of free speech guaranteed under Article 19(1)(a)of the constitution.%s
Since a constitution is only as good as the guarantee of its enforceability, it is a matter of great misfortune that this year’s ‘celebration’ comes amidst a worrying debate over whether one of keys to the constitution’s enforcement – Article 32 – may be getting diluted. If judges now start believing – as Chief Justice S.A. Bobde said during the bail hearing of journalist Siddique Kappan – that the ordinary citizen’s recourse to Article 32 needs to be “discouraged’, they might as well sign the death warrant for the constitution’s soul. India’s Temple Is its Secular ConstitutionSome commentators have described the possible dilution of the “basic structure doctrine” as the advent of “judicial barbarism” which has followed what large sections of the citizenry have experienced in terms of the hijacking of their basic democratic rights over the past six years. Whether it is the government’s authoritarian approach to Kashmir, the passage of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, the blatantly partisan investigation of the Delhi riots, the continued incarceration without bail of intellectuals and activists in the fraudulent Bhima Koregaon case and more recently the arrest and harassment of journalists, November 26, 2020 is is actually a day for mourning Samvidhan Divas, not celebrating it. It is also about the erosion of the cumulative achievement via decades of a progressive jurisprudence centred around the “basic structure doctrine” as outlined by The Wire’s legal editor V.Venkatesan in a series of important articles. This is the biggest question people need to ponder over on Samvidhan Divas 2020.Finally, this Constitution Day, let us specially remember all the prisoners of conscience who are in jail with no recourse to bail – from the octogenarians Stan Swamy and Varavara Rao to the young students being framed for the Delhi riots and all the women and men in between. The Right to Dissent is the Most Important Right Granted by the Constitution: Justice GuptaThe real disappointment for citizens facing such an unprecedented assault on their basic democratic rights is not that the Modi regime and its hatchet men are behaving the way they are.%s
The steady stream of half-baked ‘evidence’ flowing from the official investigation into those news channels which are leading the charge seems aimed at keeping a particular narrative going; the extent to which ignorant investigators and moronic media are working in tandem became clear when a text message from Rhea Chakraborty with the millennial phrase ‘Imma bounce’ (translation; ‘I’m leaving’) became a sensational news break on Times Now – a news channel owned by India’s biggest media house – about how the young woman was conspiring to bounce a cheque!Also read: The Curious Case of the Bihar Top Cop in the Limelight In TV’s rush to drown viewers in diversionary noise, Chakraborty stands a condemned woman, with all manner of accusations hurled at her – a manipulating girlfriend who stole money from her partner Sushant Singh Rajput, was on drugs and perhaps abetted or at least conspired to have him killed. On nightly television news – whose anchors serve as judge, jury and executioner in all matters – she has been vilified beyond all known limits of journalistic ethics, to say nothing of human decency. All of these wild charges are based on a deadly cocktail of innuendo, constant vilification on social media and unending sensational coverage of what was initially thought to be a simple case of death by suicide. Also read: Rhea Chakraborty’s Trial by Media Reflects Entrenched MisogynyWhatever dubious information this process has produced has been presented to the public as hard fact, without a shred of evidence. The Indian viewer is used to this level of media hysteria, of course, but if and when the history of media transgressions is written, #SSR will surely make it to the top three cases in recent times.%s

Even though his reasons, including his fragile health and the threat of the new COVID-19 strain, are well-known, his supporters had been hoping that the septuagenarian-actor, who has had a kidney transplant, would provide a credible third political force in Tamil Nadu, where duopoly has been the norm for over 40 years. The State’s political landscape will now continue to be dominated by the two established players, the ruling AIADMK and the DMK, which together cornered around 63% of votes polled in 10 Assembly elections held since 1977.%s

On June 19, elections will take place for 24 Rajya Sabha seats — only part of existing vacancies — across 10 States, and the ruling party appears to be on an overdrive to maximise its numbers. The Congress and its friendly parties count to 73, which includes Left parties (6), TMC (13), SP (8), NCP (4) and one each of JD (S), IUML and Kerala Congress (Mani). A string of losses in State elections in recent years slowed down its pursuit and there are more State polls in the near future that will influence its fortunes.%s

The long-pending upgrading of the Ganga-Padma barrage project, the draft framework of interim sharing agreements for six rivers — Manu, Muhuri, Khowai, Gumti, Dharla and Dudhkumar The two nations have come closer over a decade-long engagement that began with Ms. Hasina’s return to power in 2008, with an improvement in the strategic sphere, and alignment on regional and global issues, connectivity and trade. During this visit, the two countries have committed to upgrading port facilities, implementation of India’s under-utilised Lines of Credit, a coastal surveillance system, and agreements on education, culture and youth.%s

The course of the coronavirus pandemic in the new year presents a picture of contrasts, with some rich countries running out of vaccines, experiencing a tide of new cases and deaths, and poorer countries going without access to vaccination, while India reports a case decline. It would be wrong to read the MHA’s unlock advisory, without taking cognisance of the protocols that must continue to be followed: use of face masks, healthy distancing, staggering of working hours, workplace sanitisation and firm action against spitting in public. Amidst suggestions that the worst is over, the Home Ministry has proposed further relaxations in the protocols for public activity from February, including occupancy levels in cinema theatres, holding of exhibitions and access to swimming pools.%s
However, the report of the new variant from the U.K. and confirmed in at least 25 travellers from there puts India back at the base of a new learning curve. Even though the world has only now woken up to this variant, it may have been circulating in the U.K. as early as October, and with people flying on the U.K.-India route, it is quite likely that this  may have already caused its circulation in India. Studies show that the virus variant, while not linked yet to increasing mortality, is more transmissible than other variants, thus indirectly contributing to a higher death toll. The U.K.’s consortium of labs periodically sequences 5%-10% of the entire genome of SARS-CoV-2 isolates from the population.%s
He also hit out at attempts “to build small circles or start a new Cold War, to reject, threaten or intimidate others, to wilfully impose decoupling, supply disruption or sanctions” and said a “misguided approach of antagonism and confrontation, be it in the form of cold war, hot war, trade war or tech war, would eventually hurt all countries’ interests.” What does ring the alarm is arrogance, prejudice and hatred; it is the attempt to impose hierarchy on human civilisation or to force one’s own history, culture and social system upon others. It did also carry two messages that appeared to be aimed at Washington, a reflection of four turbulent years of a tariff and technology war between the world’s two biggest economies.%s
The government acted quickly to develop Chabahar port facilities, sent exports to Afghanistan in 2018, and has moved over half-a-million tonnes of cargo, including grains and food supplies, for Afghanistan again, through the port. Even though India was able to negotiate a sanctions waiver for the Chabahar port and rail line from the U.S., few international construction and equipment partners were willing to sign on to the project; New Delhi has also dragged its feet on the matter. According to the MoUs, India would be granted a 10-year lease to develop and operate two terminals and five berths, access to the Chabahar free trade zone, and the opportunity to build the 628 km rail line from Chabahar to Zahedan, just across the border from Afghanistan.%s
Since August, India has been reporting the highest number of cases each day, which has been steadily increasing — from over 50,000 in the last week of July to over 60,000 in the first week of August, over 70,000 in the fourth week, before jumping to over 80,000 cases in September. Though the number of tests done each day has been over one million for the past week, the test positivity rate nationally is still high at 7.7%, indicating that testing has to be ramped up.%s
While 11 died in the Andhra Pradesh incident, where a hotel had been taken over by a private hospital to run a COVID-19 care centre, nine patients perished in the blaze in a Gujarat hospital intensive care unit (ICU). This is clearly untenable, as the Supreme Court of India observed about a decade ago in the Uphaar cinema fire tragedy case in Delhi, pulling up authorities including the Union Home Ministry for abdicating responsibility and passing the buck on to the management of the institution.%s
This is mainly because the move is seen as aimed at Chinese investors who could exploit cheap valuations in the depressed economic conditions post-lockdown to pick up equity interest in select companies. The government’s decision to ban foreign direct investments (FDI) through the automatic route from neighbouring countries that share a land border with India has raised eyebrows. There has always been unease over the fact that there is a thin line that divides the state sector from private enterprise in China and several companies there trace linkages back to the security apparatus of that country.%s
The Prime Minister has recognised the calamitous rage of the virus when he called for “response and conduct” that “should attach primacy to unity and brotherhood”. Narendra Modi’s reminder that COVID-19 does not recognise “race, religion, colour, caste, creed, language or border” before striking, was axiomatic but essential. The situation was aggravated when a vocal section of the Indian diaspora, often touted as proponents of India’s interests in their host countries, was seen as Islamophobic in the UAE.%s
After the unconventional 35 basis points cut in interest rates in August, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) returned to a normal 25 basis points cut on Friday. With this, the central bank has pruned rates by 135 basis points in just seven months since the rate cut cycle started in February. While a rate cut was a foregone conclusion, the speculation was over whether it would be 25 or 40 basis points, going by the August experience.%s
In today’s milieu, net access is critical, considering that even where mobile phones and laptops are available — some States provide them under student welfare programmes — they cannot be meaningfully used in its absence. The digital chasm that separates the privileged from the deprived remains unbridged years after the broadband policy of 2004, and its effects are painfully evident during the pandemic as students struggle to log on to online classes. Only in Delhi, Himachal Pradesh and Kerala did the survey find Internet access exceeding 50% for urban and rural households taken together, while Punjab, Haryana and Uttarakhand exceeded 40%, unimpressive numbers still.%s
In and around Sivakasi, the manufacturing of firecrackers in makeshift unlicensed units, rough handling of chemicals by untrained and unskilled workers, spillage or overloading of chemicals during the filling process, and working outside permitted areas have been identified as major causes for past accidents.

South Korea’s President Moon Jae-in, whose government’s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic won acclaim, scored a political victory last week as his Democratic Party (DP) swept the parliamentary elections. But tackling these challenges arguably poses an even greater test of his leadership and political will than his government’s effective handling of the disease. While the DP won 163 seats, up 43, the progressive coalition it leads commanded 180 seats in the 300-strong National Assembly.%s
In Assam, the ruling BJP won 35 of the 47 seats in 2016, where tribal communities employed in tea estates shifted from the Congress to the BJP in large numbers.

In Assam, 47 Assembly constituencies, and in West Bengal, 30 constituencies went to the polls, with turnouts of 79.97% and 84.63%, respectively. In 2016, the ruling Trinamool Congress won 26 of the 30 seats in West Bengal in the tribal regions of Jangalmahal.%s

The storm raging in Nepal’s ruling Nepal Communist Party (NCP) is again rocking the Khadga Prasad Oli government, and putting Kathmandu’s polity in suspense over what might follow.

There is also concern over Mr. Oli’s head-on collision with India over the past few weeks, beginning with the constitutional amendment to adopt a disputed map as well as his rather rash language against India, including a recent controversy over the birthplace of the Hindu god, Lord Ram.%s
The personnel were outraged over attacks on them by lawyers at two city courts on Saturday and Monday, and the intervention by the Delhi High Court that appeared to be shielding the lawyers while being harsh on the police.

Even when the Centre amended the Citizenship Act in 2003 to introduce the Overseas Citizens of India (OCI) scheme for sections of the Indian diaspora, all it provided was a limited version of ‘dual citizenship’ which came without political rights and with a bar on purchase of agricultural land.

This refuses to leave public discourse despite the constitutional and legal position being clearly against the grant of dual citizenship per se.%s

Fortunately, the first line of defence against the novel coronavirus is a set of simple measures that involves little expenditure: physical distancing of at least one metre, mandatory use of face masks or cover, frequent hand washing with soap, respiratory etiquette, sanitising contact surfaces and self-monitoring of health. These requirements have by now become familiar to everyone, and employees need only be nudged into adopting them through persistent communication, free provisioning of masks and sanitising materials, and organising office space suitably.%s
However, it ruled that Nagaraj was wrong to require a demonstration of backwardness for the Scheduled Castes and Tribes, as it was directly contrary to the nine-judge Bench judgment in Indra Sawhney (1992), which had laid down that there is no need for a test of backwardness for SC/STs, as “they indubitably fall within the expression ‘backward class of citizens’. Even while upholding Constitution amendments meant to preserve reservation in promotions as well as consequential seniority, it contained an exposition of the equality principle that hedged reservation against a set of constitutional requirements, without which the structure of equal opportunity would collapse. These were ‘quantifiable data’ to show the backwardness of a community, the inadequacy of its representation in service, and the lack of adverse impact on “the overall efficiency of administration”.%s
The healthiest indirect tax collection streak since the national lockdown to combat COVID-19 in March, it is an encouraging sign for the economy that contracted less-than-expected in the second quarter. This suggests that the first month of the third quarter did see a genuine improvement in activity, whether it was driven by pent-up or festive demand, or a bit of both. With Deepavali falling in November this year (it was in October last year), some festive spending effect may be expected to come through in December’s GST collections as well.%s
The BJP’s unrelenting pursuit of influence has unsettled conventional calculations in all these areas that are outside the core of the party’s traditional catchment area. In 2016, the BJP had won only three seats in West Bengal, but its rise was dramatic in the 2019 Lok Sabha election when it won 18 of the 42 seats and 40.64% of votes. The significant strength of Muslim voters in West Bengal is often cited as a demographic barrier for the Hindu nationalist party, but communal politics works best in areas where minorities mobilise in significant proportions.%s
Section 77 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, which relates to a candidate’s election expenditure, does leave it to the political party itself to decide who its “leaders” are and allows every party to submit a list of such ‘star campaigners’ to the election authorities. However, it should be noted that the ‘star campaigner’ status comes with a clear privilege: the expenditure incurred on the campaign done by those from the list of star campaigners is not included in the expenditure of the candidate concerned.%s
Meanwhile, complaints of denial of patient care, exploitative billing by private hospitals, and deliberate attempts to underreport cases and deaths have surfaced. The national capital is staring at an even bleaker situation ahead, as cases are expected to cross 5.5 lakh by July-end. All this was to be expected and in fact, the purpose of the national lockdown that continued for 10 weeks until June 7 was to prepare the health infrastructure for such a surge.%s
How did a terrorism convict slip off the security radar and launch an attack in the capital city at a time when Europe was on high alert following the terror assaults in France? The attack in Vienna that killed four people on Monday night underscores the transnational threat European countries face from Islamist terrorists.

Mr. Conte, a former law professor who first formed the government in 2018, resigned after a small coalition partner, Italia Viva, led by former PM Matteo Renzi, left after differences over the way the government was tackling the outbreak and its plans to spend the $243 billion EU virus fund. The vaccination programme, which the government rolled out in recent weeks, has been criticised for being too slow (the government has blamed drugmaker Pfizer for poor supply).%s

The turmoil in Rajasthan has also been yet another occasion to note with deep concern the tendency of the judiciary to overstep its remit set by law, brazen partisanship of the Governor, and misuse of central agencies to tilt the political balance.

It’s an achievement India should be proud of, for England, despite losing the Tests comprehensively (1-3), proved that it was a formidable limited-overs side, as reflected in its status as the world’s top-ranked outfit in both ODIs and T20Is and in the fact that both series required deciders. The wicket-taking exploits of Shardul Thakur (eight in T20Is and seven in ODIs to top the lists), successful debuts for Ishan Kishan and Suryakumar Yadav in T20Is, and Prasidh Krishna and Krunal Pandya in ODIs, and Hardik Pandya’s full-fledged return to bowling duties were big positives.%s
The government’s push on infrastructure development will not only enable ease of living — such as metro trains in cities and towns — but also create jobs and increase demand for primary commodities such as cement and steel.

The JMM-Congress-Rashtriya Janata Dal coalition bagged 47 of the 81 Assembly seats largely due to a clear mandate against the Raghubar Das-led BJP, especially from the State’s tribal and rural voters even as some urban voters also switched allegiance to the former.

While more solutions were found to Einstein’s equations that suggested black holes, they all required special symmetries and their realisation under general astrophysical conditions was doubtful. This was a time when the reality of black holes as a solution to Albert Einstein’s field equations of the General Theory of Relativity was not accepted by many prominent physicists. In this climate came observational hints of supermassive black holes, through the discovery of what were initially called quasars that were supermassive and found at the centre of galaxies.%s

Mobs of pro-CAA demonstrators and anti-CAA protesters wielding sticks and weapons have taken over parts of the city and the Delhi police have proved themselves woefully inadequate at best and outrageously partisan and communal at worst, in responding to the situation. There was arson and violence on December 16, in areas around the Jamia Milia Islamia, to which the police responded by indiscriminately unleashing violence on students inside the university. Communal violence in parts of Delhi, an earshot away from the nerve centre of the government of India, has claimed 13 lives and left over 150 injured.%s
The janata curfew, on March 22, ahead of the lockdown was obviously a drill for the three-week imposition, but the government failed to anticipate the complex issues involved in confining over a billion people to their homes. Of course, as a public health measure, the full national lockdown announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi is being welcomed by the medical community as a necessary measure to cut the transmission chain of the virus. India’s unprecedented 21-day national lockdown is an unparalleled effort at stopping the march of a fast-spreading scourge that has overwhelmed the health infrastructure of several nations.%s
Along the way, he has not just forgotten his signature agenda of an anti-corruption ombudsman and decentralised governance, but also concentrated so much power that AAP is synonymous with the leader.

Fired up by an infinite capacity to fight, the AAP founder leader has been a match for the BJP amid the vast ruins of Opposition politics in India.%s
This, no doubt, required spinning a careful web of deception, right from submitting photos of the impersonator in the NEET application forms, to actually appearing for the examinations and single-window counselling for admissions, to submitting the application with the original student’s photo at the allotted college. A number of students and their parents were investigated for possible impersonation fraud in the NEET, for operating with the help of middlemen to hire a medical student to write the test for them, for a hefty consideration. While the larger picture, with all its many nuances, is not yet clear, it is evident that fraud has been committed, and serious lapses in procedures and processes were exploited by students eager to score a medical seat by hook or by crook.%s
If this is accepted, then the number of people found to have been exposed to the virus would be 7 lakh people or more, if the overall population of these districts is considered, much higher than the 35,000 people who had tested positive in the entire country during this period. Serological tests, despite inaccuracies, can be a useful guide of the extent of the infections among vulnerable people and within hot spots, and periodic tests of this kind are a must amid the rise of cases that have now crossed the 3.2 lakh mark. The results of a serological test conducted across 69 districts by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) have indicated that the confirmed numbers of COVID-19 infections reported from the RT-PCR tests are likely an undercount.%s

A Bench headed by the Chief Justice of India, Justice S.A.

The portion of the 2019 order asking political parties to submit to the Election Commission in a sealed cover all details of the anonymous contributions received through electoral bonds was meant to avoid tilting the balance in favour of either side until the matter was heard in detail. It was also underscored then that “weighty issues which have a tremendous bearing on the sanctity of the electoral process in the country” were involved.%s

The perilous use of manja, a synthetic kite string coated with powdered glass, remains pervasive, endangering human lives and making a mockery of the multiple bans on its manufacture and sale. Three-year-old Abhinayu of Chennai, who died on Sunday after a dangling manja slit his neck while he was seated on a motorcycle his father rode, is the latest victim.%s
The Gautama Buddha Nagar police have clearly gone overboard in their response to tweets that reflected an early, and factually incorrect, piece of information that a farmer who had died during the tractor rally in Delhi had fallen to a police bullet. The registration of cases against some senior journalists and Congress MP Shashi Tharoor for their “misleading” social media posts on the Republic Day violence during the farmers’ protests in Delhi, by the U.P. and M.P. police is an instance of fishing for malice where there is none.%s
The welcome decision by the Kingdom of Tonga to outlaw the worst forms of child labour is the first time in the International Labour Organization (ILO)’s 101-year history that a labour standard has been universally ratified. Convention 182, which was adopted in the 1999 annual international labour conference, prohibits the sexual exploitation of children, trafficking, deployment in armed conflict and other conditions that compromise their overall well-being.%s
The Tamil Nadu government’s decision to impose a complete lockdown in Chennai and parts of neighbouring Chengalpattu, Kancheepuram and Thiruvallur for 12 days from June 19 is a response to rising apprehension that the coronavirus pandemic has spun out of control. When such a measure was resorted to earlier, for four days from April 26, the cumulative cases in the State were 1,821, but they have snowballed to just over 46,500 cases on June 15.%s

Teaming with Dr. Doudna, she recreated the bacteria’s genetic scissors in a test tube and simplified the tool to make it easier to programme the system to precisely cut specific sites of interest in any DNA, including humans. That scientists who pioneered the revolutionary CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing technology, the biggest game-changer in biology in recent years, will win the Nobel Prize was never in doubt; it was only a question of when and who would get recognised for the work done to develop the tool.%s
Reflecting the overall concern on lost academic activities, the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations has appealed to States to allow its schools to open Classes 10 and 12 in a limited way early in January. Buoyed by vaccine optimism, educational administrators are working with vigour to end the prolonged disruption to schooling, and conduct traditional pen-and-paper public examinations in 2021.%s

The Socialists have emerged as the largest party, unlike in 2015, when the centre-right Social Democrat (PSD)’s failure presented them with an opportunity to forge a coalition. The two left-wing parties backed a minority PS government only on the latter’s promise to end the austerity policies of the centre-right administration.%s

New Zealand cricket captain Kane Williamson gave catching practice to his dog, England all-rounder Ben Stokes bowled in the driveway, Indian tennis star Rohan Bopanna slammed forehands into walls while speedster Jasprit Bumrah cleaned his home daily. Even if sport is shedding its rust as evident in the Bundesliga football that commenced in Germany, sports icons in the world at large and specifically in India, needed their regular fix of training at grounds and gyms. Seen in that light, the Home Ministry’s diktat that stadia can be opened across India without the crowds, a point echoed by Sports Minister Kiren Rijiju, is welcome news for athletes of all shades, be it Olympians or cue-sports players.%s
The deaths occurred when the two armies had agreed to “disengage” and “de-escalate” the month-long stand-off, which makes the clashes particularly shocking. In his talks with External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi appeared to countenance this new position, and even called on India to “punish those responsible” for crossing the LAC, prompting India to accuse China of attempting to “alter With the deaths of at least 20 Indian soldiers, and reports of Chinese soldier casualties in clashes at the Galwan valley in Ladakh, India and China have entered uncharted territory on the Line of Actual Control, the first combat deaths since 1975, and the first such in the Galwan Valley since the 1962 war.%s
By that standard, U.S. President Donald Trump’s peace plan for Israel and Palestine is a failure from the start as the Palestinians rejected it even before the proposals were unveiled. It also recognises Jerusalem as the “undivided capital” of Israel, while the Palestinian capital could come up in the eastern outskirts of the city. But to achieve the solution, the plan overly favours the Israeli positions and demands excessive concessions from the Palestinians.%s
The government has continued to propagate the laws — the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act — as measures that will enhance agriculture incomes. Farmers protesting against three agriculture reform laws, and on related issues, have reached a partial agreement with the Centre on Wednesday, but the main points of contention remain unresolved. Flexibility by farmers and a reconciliatory approach by the government led to the partial agreement, but the core concerns regarding the laws and MSP are not amenable to easy resolution.%s
Responding to concerns, the Centre has suggested safeguards to prevent land alienation via contract farming; strengthening the State-run mandi system and ensuring its equal footing with private buyers through equalising taxes; allowing grievance redress in civil courts rather than just in the offices of Sub-Divisional Magistrates; and ensuring proper verification of private traders.%s
Physical distancing of people, ensured through a suspension of rail and inter-State bus services, closure of public places, cessation of all non-essential activity and street-level monitoring, is the first order priority during a pandemic and the lockdown can ensure that. As a war-like moment in the country’s history, it calls for massive preparation with all hands on deck to mitigate the impact on people, and to formulate a public health response for the period beyond the shutdown. India has responded to the spectre of large-scale transmission of the novel coronavirus and the unprecedented public health catastrophe it may bring by ordering a full national lockdown.%s
It will be hard for security forces in Chhattisgarh to live down the assertion by the Justice V.K. Agarwal judicial enquiry commission that no evidence existed to support the claim that the 17 people who died in the “encounter” on the night of June 28-29, 2012, in three villages in Bijapur and Sukma districts were “Naxalites”.%s
For one thing, the PCA, an arbitral tribunal that adjudicates disputes under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), has itself ruled that India is entitled to compensation for “loss of life, physical harm, material damage to property... and moral harm suffered by” the captain and crew members of St. Antony, the fishing vessel involved, and mandated negotiations on the quantum. However, it is somewhat puzzling that the Supreme Court of India has said it would keep the Italian marines’ case alive until “hefty” and “adequate” compensation is paid by Italy for the killing of two fishermen by its marines on February 15, 2012.%s
Though growth concerns are still paramount, a lot has changed between the earlier policies and now — inflation is rearing its head up again and the government’s approach to the fiscal deficit glide path is still unclear even as the macro numbers indicate a considerable slippage in the target of 3.3% for this fiscal. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has taken care to point out that “there is monetary policy space for future action” and that the accommodative stance will continue.%s
As several vaccine efforts are progressing at varying paces, globally, concerns about access to a vaccine in the future have crept into the narrative. Whether or not a vaccine for COVID-19 is around the corner, it is imperative that a vaccine policy is formulated for India, ensuring parity of access for all. As Dr. Tedros said, “some people in all countries, rather than all people in some countries”, should have access to the vaccine in the early phase.%s
The Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) in Delhi, which provides for a ratcheting slew of measures — from stopping construction work to halting private vehicles — isn’t effective when air quality reaches its nadir. What differentiates the prevalent PM crisis from earlier ones is the public’s ability to monitor pollution levels for themselves. However, increased public awareness and social media angst haven’t translated into meaningful public action.%s
In a tweet, he said this was in light of “the need to protect the jobs of our GREAT American Citizens”, even though the order is not expected to halt visa processing for many thousands of temporary employees, potentially including a sizeable number of Indian nationals in the H-1B skilled worker category; and seasonal workers in areas like landscaping, agribusinesses, and service jobs in hospitality, who fall into the H-2B category.%s
Key amendments were brought in to provide for death penalty for rape that led to death of the victim or reduced the survivor to a persistent vegetative state and anyone found guilty of rape more than once. In 2018, further changes introduced death as the maximum punishment for every perpetrator in a gang-rape when the victim is less than 12, and life-long imprisonment if the victim is less than 16.%s
However the survivors, including a production assistant who said he had forced her to have sex in 2006, and a former actress who said he had raped her at a hotel in 2013, said that he was a predator whose premeditated actions included not only the attacks on the survivors but also attempts to leverage his power over their professional lives to buy their silence. His New York courtroom trial, during which six women testified that he assaulted them, was a touchstone for the global #MeToo movement and for holding powerful, wealthy men accountable for the sexual harassment and assault of women.%s
The presiding officers of both Houses have had trial runs, but it will be a tough act for them and the MPs — who are used to huddling together and speaking aloud — to deliberate across two chambers and keeping a safe distance from one another. The Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha will alternate their sittings so that members can spread over both chambers to ensure physical distancing necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The break, between 1 p.m. and 3 p.m., would be used to disinfect the chambers.%s

The review began on Wednesday instead of September 29, after the RBI had to reschedule it on the eve of the meeting following the government’s failure to appoint its three nominees to the six-member committee. Even if the hunt for new members was disrupted by the pandemic, the government had ample time to expedite these appointments after August 6, when the last policy review took place.

That the new rules pertain only to digital news media, and not to the whole of the news media, hardly provides comfort, as the former is increasingly becoming a prime source of news and views. The new rules introduced by the Centre last week to regulate all types of digital platforms, with the idea of redressing user grievances and ensuring compliance with the law, are deeply unsettling as they will end up giving the government a good deal of leverage over online news publishers and intermediaries.%s

Coming soon after the fire that snuffed out the lives of infants in Bhandara, again in Maharashtra, the tragedy focuses attention on the failure to make fire safety a systemic imperative in public buildings. It should be pointed out that after a fire in Rajkot last November, the Supreme Court took suo motu cognisance of the incident and issued directions, one of which was to task an officer with fire safety for each COVID-19 hospital. Firefighters keep reminding people that fire is a good servant but a bad master, and the blaze that engulfed a private COVID-19 hospital in Mumbai’s Bhandup area on Thursday night comes as a reminder of how true that axiom is.%s
Among those fighting for the nomination, Mr. Sanders perhaps stands the best chance of surviving a toe-to-toe battle with Mr. Trump, given that, like his Republican challenger, he stands somewhat askance of his party’s mainstream ethos, for example showing the mettle to take on Wall Street’s excesses rather than lean on them for fund-raising support. Indeed, Mr. Trump’s Democratic rivals have trained their political guns on his record in office for some time now, making it quite likely that the November 2020 presidential poll will be preceded by a blistering campaign.%s

It was therefore disappointing for the government to note that in June, the OIC appointed a “special envoy” on Jammu and Kashmir, and subsequently issued several strongly worded statements on the government’s decision to amend Article 370 of the Constitution, the Supreme Court verdict on the Ayodhya dispute and the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019, or the CAA. The government’s outreach to the grouping was seen as a way of strengthening ties with the “Muslim world” including West Asian countries where more than six million Indians live and work.%s
The reasons given by the police across India for arresting reporters and editors of news portals indicate that special provisions enacted to prevent the spread of rumour during disasters are being used to suppress reporting on political developments and possible governmental corruption. The arrest of Dhaval Patel, editor of a news portal in Gujarat, on the serious charge of sedition, is a shocking instance of misuse of criminal laws to intimidate journalists.%s
These came to light when WHO was informed in May that year, more than five months after the first case was laboratory-confirmed; the excuse was that the government wanted to avoid creating “panic”. Such irresponsible behaviour by China had led to the spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus that claimed 774 lives globally in the early 2000s.%s
And that is to give a strong supply-side push by boosting availability of capital on easy terms, keep income and wage support schemes to the minimum, empower constituencies ranging from farmers and workers to businesses, and finally, the most important, keep the damage to the fisc as low as possible. The Centre’s problem is that its revenues are a fraction of what it would have been in a normal situation but even given this handicap, a fiscal stimulus could have been fitted into the overall package.%s
As per the document inviting Expression of Interest (EOI), the government will sell 100% equity in the national carrier and Air India Express Ltd. and its 50% holding in AISATS, the joint venture with SATS Ltd., Singapore; the debt that the buyer will assume has been whittled down to ₹23,286.50 crore to match the written down value of its assets; the net worth of prospective bidders is reduced to ₹3,500 crore and bidding consortium members can have as low a stake as 10% only. Of the three troublesome factors that put off bidders the last time round — the government’s insistence on holding a 24% stake in the airline post-privatisation, the large debt that it was expecting the buyer to assume and employee issues —%s

The growing number of such attacks, despite the U.S. steadily enhancing its air campaign against Shabaab and other militants in the country in recent years, have not only exposed the inability, if not incompetence, of the federal government in ensuring security but also sent a message to the government’s regional and international backers that their attempts to get a stable government in the Horn of Africa country are reaching nowhere. The massive truck bomb attack on December 28, 2019 in Mogadishu that killed at least 79 people and injured 149 points to a resurgent terrorist threat in Somalia.%s
The U.S., along with other international powers, had signed a nuclear deal with Iran in 2015 and both countries were cooperating in the war against the Islamic State in Iraq. Any retaliatory actions by Iran could cause a further flare-up, even leading to an open war, which could scuttle diplomatic options for a Biden administration.%s
Five decades after the oil shock of 1973, when an Arab embargo on the supply of oil to some western powers including the United States sent the price of crude skyrocketing fourfold to $12 a barrel, the global economy faces a fresh shock from a free-fall in oil prices. While the unprecedented plunge in the particular futures contract could be partly explained away as a technical anomaly given that the May contract was set to expire on Tuesday, beyond which buyers would need to be ready to take physical delivery, the reality is that oil prices are desperately in search of a bottom.%s
Rejecting the purported evidence presented by the Delhi Police against climate change activist Disha Ravi, as “scanty and sketchy”, Judge Dharmender Rana has granted bail to the 22-year-old arrested for nothing more than editing a document shared among a network of activists raising global support for the farmers’ protests against three central laws.%s
Article 15(3), which states ‘nothing in this article shall prevent the State from making any special provision for women and children’, read together with Article 39, which directs state policy towards equal pay and opportunities for both men and women, and protecting the health of women and children, are two key constitutional safeguards. The court ruled that an abandoned wife and children will be entitled to ‘maintenance’ from the date she applies for it in a court of law.%s
This year, however, the monsoon broke even this speed limit and covered the country by June 25 — at a pace that was unprecedented since 2013. According to this, the monsoon covered India’s northern and western borders no later than July 8 as opposed to the previous historical date of July 15. Along with the monsoon onset this year, the IMD announced a revision to the onset and withdrawal dates across several cities. Both branches eventually converge in the north and usually, this merging and strengthening of the monsoon currents over the mainland takes at least until July 15.%s
It would have been more appropriate if the police had investigated the matter thoroughly and filed a charge sheet in a court of law if there was sufficient evidence to believe that the conduct of the accused had driven the victim to suicide. It might be true that the police then may have, under political influence, unlawfully closed a complaint that Mr. Goswami and two others had abetted the suicide of Anvay Naik, an interior designer in May 2018, and that there may be sufficient cause for it to be investigated afresh.%s

Researchers have found that such candidates with serious records seem to do well despite their public image, largely due to their ability to finance their own elections and bring substantive resources to their respective parties. The Supreme Court has taken a timely decision by agreeing to hear a plea from the Election Commission of India (ECI) to direct political parties to not field candidates with criminal antecedents.%s
Israel’s new unity government, which has ended a protracted political deadlock, after three inconclusive elections in a year, is likely to oversee worsening tensions with the Palestinians as annexation of Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank is high on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s agenda.

Australia’s Foreign Minister Marise Payne attended despite the two-week quarantine that she faces on return, and India’s External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar undertook the journey despite the government’s preoccupation with the LAC standoff. He called on the entire Quad to “collaborate to protect” the region from what he called the “CCP’s exploitation, corruption, and coercion”, pointing to the LAC standoff, as well as Chinese aggression in the South and East China Seas. But in Tokyo, he made it clear that his mission was to direct the Quad towards building a coalition to counter Beijing’s aggression in the region, saying that their partnership was not “multilateralism for the sake of it”.%s
The attack on a gurdwara in Kabul on March 25 that killed at least 25 people, mostly members of Afghanistan’s persecuted Sikh minority, is a barefaced attempt by the Islamic State (IS) to revive its fortunes in the country at a time when it is politically divided and the peace process is hamstrung by the Taliban’s continuing violence. The IS, which is concentrated in the eastern parts of Afghanistan, carried out several attacks in the past targeting the country’s minorities.%s

In the last decade, these have included India’s concerns about the pace of reconciliation in the Tamil-majority North and East, the welcoming of Chinese investment for major projects including the Hambantota port and Colombo harbour and military engagement, unhappiness over the slow pace of clearance for Indian projects, and other bilateral issues. The visit last week of Sri Lanka’s new President Gotabaya Rajapaksa to India and his extended talks with Prime Minister Narendra Modi was an affirmation by the two nations to make good bilateral ties a priority for each. Mr. Rajapaksa accepted Mr. Modi’s invitation to make his first presidential visit abroad to New Delhi, and has invited the Indian leader to be the first State guest he welcomes to Colombo.%s
The move may have been born out of political expediency, in response to the restive pre-election agitation organised by the Pattali Makkal Katchi demanding 20% exclusive reservation in education and government jobs for the Vanniyar community, its main electoral base. In Tamil Nadu, sections of the Vanniyars, whose violent 1987-88 agitation resulted in the creation of a ‘most backward classes’ category entitled to 20% reservation, are apparently dissatisfied about being clubbed with over a hundred other castes.%s
But the regional divide is stark in basic livelihood goals such as “eradication of poverty”, and “good health and well being” or even in measures such as “industry, innovation and infrastructure”. The South, led by Kerala and Tamil Nadu, has done much more in orienting administrative institutions to deliver on basic welfare, leading to actions on health care, education, poverty eradication and hunger, with a governance structure tuned to competitively monitoring actions on these fronts. Poor performers such as Uttar Pradesh have shown discernible advances in the indices — measured between 2018-19 — especially in adopting cleaner energy and improving sanitation.%s
After his announcement in December 2017 that he would form a political party in time to contest in all 234 Assembly constituencies of Tamil Nadu in 2021, his tweets, brief observations and curt replies to journalists’ queries, in the last three years, did not present any coherent view about his policies and programmes. At a time when the composition of the coalitions headed by the two big parties, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) and the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) is considered a settled matter, Mr. Rajinikanth’s entry might now provide greater room for smaller parties to negotiate into an alliance.%s
As the head of the Congress State unit, Mr. Pilot played a crucial role in the victory of the party in 2018 and his disappointment at losing the top post to Mr. Gehlot soon became a festering wound into which the latter only rubbed salt. By going public with his resentment and marshalling legislators in his camp to BJP-ruled Haryana, Mr. Pilot gave a fillip to speculation that the BJP was involved as it was in toppling the Congress government in Madhya Pradesh in March.%s
While in absolute terms, the allocations for the scheme in the budget presented in July 2019 were higher compared to the previous financial year, the outlay fell in relative terms as a percentage of the overall allocations. With the ongoing economic slowdown resulting in depressed rural wages and the lack of adequate opportunity to work, the MGNREGS has provided much needed succour and this explains why demand for it has peaked in the last few months across various parts of the country.%s
The BJP unilaterally announced 164 seats for itself out of the total 288 and the Sena, which used to get the lion’s share of Assembly seats and the CM’s post, meekly accepted the situation. This supremacy of the BJP is partly due to national factors, but the fact that the party’s Hindutva nationalist politics has trumped the Sena’s regional agenda is itself noteworthy. The Bhima Koregaon incident of 2018 in which a Dalit gathering was attacked by a violent group was followed by an extensive crackdown on social activists and Dalits by the State police.%s
The Maoists retreated and fired again and the security forces fired and followed till they had been lured into an open area in hilly terrain where the Maoists, some 350 of them, had the advantage of numbers, line of fire as well as height, a classic ambush.  The attack by Maoist extremists in Chhattisgarh’s Sukma district on Saturday, that killed 17 security personnel and injured 15, including two critically, presents a grim picture on how poorly India continues to fare on this front.%s
Despite the country being under lockdown since almost end-March, the number of fresh cases and deaths reported each day has continued to rise steadily — on average, over 3,600 cases have been reported daily since May 8. That even during the lockdown India has witnessed the shortest time, of 13 days, for cases to double compared with 14 other countries that have the most cases reported is testimony to the wide spread of the virus. On March 18, when China reported zero fresh cases, India had just 162 cases and three deaths.%s
The sweeping circular, issued in consultation with the External Affairs Ministry, created a bottleneck for scientists in public universities, colleges and organisations and erected new bureaucratic barriers in a pandemic-hit phase when virtual conferences are the only viable channel for researchers to collaborate with global peers. Academicians and others organising the events were, as per the January circular, required to get prior official approval and ensure that the conference topics do not relate to security of the state, border, the northeast, Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh, and broadly, any “internal matters%s
The unfortunate death of Sepoy Lungabui Abonmli, and the airlifting of two other soldiers, Lienkhothien Senghon and Sepoy Tangsoik Kwianiungar, to the Command Hospital in Udhampur because of injuries due to shelling in Poonch sector are the latest grim reminders of this phenomenon. The shelling and the retaliations along the Line of Control with Pakistan are a matter of consternation, because it has been allowed to go on so long as to become an everyday occurrence. When shells begin raining, villagers panic, leave their homes and run further, to temporary shelters.%s

President Andrzej Duda’s re-election in Sunday’s close run-off was a critical iteration for Poland’s ultra-nationalist government, which has been mired in a stand-off with the EU over the country’s slide into authoritarianism and erosion of the rule of law.

A closer look at the Consumer Price Index reveals that prices in the food and beverages group rose an average 7.3% year-on-year, with the key protein sources of pulses and products surging 16.7%, meat and fish climbing 16.2%, and milk and its derivatives rising 8.4%. Inflation in the food category would have been much faster but for vegetables and fruits moderating the gains as anxious growers likely sold the perishables at distress rates resulting in fruits showing a 0.7% deflation and vegetables posting a marginal 1.9% gain.%s
The registration of multiple police cases in Uttar Pradesh on charges of conspiracy and sedition is an insensitive, albeit unsurprising, response to the legitimate outrage sparked by the way in which its officials had handled the aftermath of the gang rape and murder of a Dalit girl in Hathras. There seems to be inadequate recognition that initial attempts to deny that any rape took place and to prevent political leaders and the media from meeting the girl’s family pointed to an administrative posture hostile to the doing of complete justice.%s
More importantly, while exports to RCEP countries account for just 15% of India’s total exports, imports from RCEP countries make up 35% of the country’s total imports. That India runs a massive bilateral trade deficit of $53 billion with China and the fact that China has not taken satisfactory efforts to whittle down the deficit certainly were major inputs in India’s decision. On the one side was the looming figure of China in the group and that country’s desperate need to find newer markets for its products in the backdrop of its trade dispute with the U.S.%s

While it may be debatable as to how much of the turn in the pandemic’s progress could be attributed wholly to proactive policy measures, the survey’s contention that India has turned the crisis into an opportunity to strengthen its long-term growth potential through ‘seminal reforms’ sounds off-key, especially given the ongoing farmers’ agitation against the new farm laws as well as the plight of the struggling small and medium-scale industries and informal sectors.%s
Thanks to the blurring of regional and language boundaries in cinema in recent years, a Tamil or a Telugu film, for instance, now stands a better chance at enjoying a pan-Indian theatrical release with subtitles, and thereafter reaching wider audiences through digital platforms. The announcement of the 67th National Film Awards on Monday, to recognise films certified in 2019, quite predictably drew its share of controversies. However, there was no disputing the fact that the awards acknowledged both well known and less known films from different pockets of the country.%s
’s girlfriend Rhea Chakraborty, 28, of foul play; the grief-stricken father said she had poisoned his son and filed an FIR charging Rhea with ‘abetment to suicide’, a crime punishable by up to 10 years in prison. The actor, reported to have been suffering from depression, lived in Mumbai, which is now ruled by estranged Bharatiya Janata Party partner, the Shiv Sena, together with the Nationalist Congress Party and Congress, and his demise has become political fodder crossing limits of decency, drawing in other Bollywood celebrities.%s
Further, he accused the judge of proximity with Mr. Reddy’s political rivals and alleged involvement of his family members in a land scam that involved prior knowledge that Amaravati was to be declared the State’s capital and speculative buying of land there. There is little to commend the requirement of confidentiality in a probe of this nature, as the dismissal of the complaint ipso facto means that a serving CM has levelled false and motivated charges against a senior Supreme Court judge as well as those in the High Court. The lack of transparency is based on a 2003 judgment of the apex court that any inquiry under this procedure is meant only for “the information and satisfaction” of the CJI, and is not meant for the public.%s
Unlike other extreme weather events, heat waves last much longer, are grossly under-reported and they are not even recognised under the National Disaster Management Act, 2005, making the phenomenon-related impacts ineligible for money from national or state disaster response funds. The National Institute of Disaster Management (NIDM) sends out advisories on heat waves and most states have introduced Heat Action Plans (HAPs), but these action plans and warning systems can only be effective with more resources. The additional funding is needed to ensure cooler worksites, climate-resilient housing, strengthening forecasting and early warning systems, building capacity of health care professionals, making cities more green, and increasing engagement with civil society organisations to spread awareness.%s
This oversight has continued for decades despite the Interstate Migrant Workmen Act of 1979, which regulates the conditions of service of circular migrant workers; mandates the registration of contractors who employ migrants; and also requires employers to maintain a record of their workers. In March 2020, it announced that 800 million beneficiaries would be provided an additional five kg of wheat or rice and a kilo of pulses, free of cost every month till November; unveiled a plan to employ returning migrants in some states; launched a skill-mapping programme; and promised to fast-track nationwide portability of ration cards.%s
Two, given Mr Biden’s emphasis on democracy, there will remain increased scrutiny of the quality of Indian democracy — and while this will not undermine India’s position as a strategic partner, it will pose hitches. Last week, in his first detailed press conference after assuming presidency, United States (US) president Joe Biden laid out his impressive report card on the battle against Covid-19 — the administration has doubled the vaccination target and now aims to administer 200 million vaccine shots in its first 100 days. The president said, based on his extensive personal interactions with Xi Jinping, that China’s president was straightforward, smart, lacked any democratic bone in his body, and believed autocracy was the “wave of the future”.%s
she has respected India’s security needs, and in turn, Delhi has backed her, both politically, even at the cost of turning a blind eye to Bangladesh’s democratic backsliding, and economically. The future of India’s Act East policy, stability and development in the Northeast, economic integration in the larger region, climate crisis, cross-border flow of people, and peace and security are contingent on ties with Dhaka. There remain issues, of course, from India’s inability to seal a Teesta water-sharing deal to Beijing’s enhanced push in Bangladesh. If Sri Lanka is crucial to India’s maritime interests in the Indian Ocean as well as stability in south India, Pakistan is important, largely because of its track record of hostility and terrorism. Respecting each other’s sovereignty and interests, within an inclusive, connected and democratic region, is the best road map for the future.%s
This will require the government to step up genome surveillance; pharmaceutical companies to double down on vaccine production (and perhaps even come up with more resilient doses); and citizens to arm themselves with the two tools that can stop the virus, no matter what the variant — vaccines and appropriate behaviour. It is the third aspect — determining how far a variant has spread and its containment — that is particularly difficult. In August, scientists in Singapore said they found a mutation that was milder — but in line with laws of evolution, it was overtaken by variants that were “fitter” in spreading. In several countries, most notably in the United Kingdom (UK), at the outset of winter last year, a variant set off a runaway outbreak — not unlike what appears to be building in India at the moment. The two states have recorded some of the sharpest increase in cases over the last month, with Maharashtra contributing more than half the new cases recorded across the country daily.%s
The project is expected to ensure drinking water to 6.2 million people and irrigate one million hectares of land in 13 districts across both states, the majority of which fall in the water-starved Bundelkhand region, which has seen back-to-back droughts in the last decade. The region’s granite topography does not allow rainwater to seep in and recharge the groundwater table, but this problem has been aggravated by policies that support faulty cropping patterns, encourage groundwater exploitation, degrade the soil and hack away at forest cover. The agreement was signed 18 years after the project was first conceived as a part of country’s programme to interlink rivers to provide water to areas facing scarcity.%s
As the government tabled, and sought to pass, the Bihar Special Armed Police Bill, 2021 — based on the rationale that the state’s growing security needs, including protection of vital installations, required a special empowered force — the opposition demanded its withdrawal, based on what it saw as draconian provisions giving this force the power to search and arrest without warrant. But what was even more wrong was the government’s failure to politically resolve the issue — either by engaging with the opposition or sending the bill to a legislative committee — and instead calling on security forces to clear the House; the police engaged in a scuffle with legislators, including women leaders. The opposition, however, then turned aggressive — gheraoing the Speaker’s chamber, obstructing house proceedings when other presiding officers took the chair, and crowding the well of the House.%s
While the Rajapaksa regime makes the right noises, its revocation of a port contract to India (and Japan) in the island’s east, even as it continues to deepen ties with China, including giving it projects in the north, has shown that Colombo is not a strategically reliable partner. ’s continued ethnic exclusivism internally (which has repercussions in Tamil Nadu, a state about to go to polls), and shift towards China externally have led India to abstain from a vote at a top UN human rights body asking Sri Lanka to do more. But the move has neither pleased Colombo, which wanted India to vote against the resolution, nor Tamil Nadu’s parties, which wanted India to vote for the resolution. During the three-decade long civil war between Colombo and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), New Delhi moved from covert support to Tamil militants in the early 1980s to sending a peacekeeping force in the late 1980s to taking a strong position against LTTE in the 1990s after it assassinated former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. It finally, quietly, supported Mahinda Rajapaksa’s final offensive against LTTE in 2009 — quietly, because New Delhi did not want to alienate the Tamil street at home.%s
Citizens were told to stay home, maintain social distancing, avoid all contact with the external world, follow Covid-19 protocols, and aid the nation in helping break — or slow down — the chain of transmission, even as India was to use the period to build up its health infrastructure to cope with the most devastating pandemic in a century. The Mahakumbh in Uttarakhand is only one example of how faith (and the politics of faith) is being allowed to trump science, at great risk — the farm protests at Delhi’s borders or the crowds in election rallies in different states are no different in enhancing the risk for citizens. The good news is that so is the vaccine, and India has, although too gradually for this newspaper’s liking, begun vaccinating citizens — Tuesday’s decision to open it up to all citizens above 45 years is positive. Based on the scientific evidence available at the time, global trends, an assessment of India’s health infrastructure deficits, and the possibility of rapid transmission given the population and its density, a lockdown was necessary. Flights in and out of the country had already been stopped earlier, and now, all movement — except for essential workers — was halted.%s
On Monday, the Delhi government proposed sweeping changes in its excise policy in an attempt to boost the city’s revenue, crackdown on the liquor mafia, and improve consumer experience. Its salient points include lowering the legal age of drinking in the Capital from 25 to 21; the government’s exit from the retail alcohol business; and an overhaul of the tax system. The Delhi government’s attempt can help create a more reasonable and effective regulatory regime, and ensure that responsible drinking is seen as a legitimate social activity rather than treated as a crime. The consumer experience at the city’s liquor shops is awful, especially for women. Delhi is one of India’s biggest liquor markets, and this serves as a major source of income for the government.%s
From Narendra Modi’s focus on toilet construction and distribution of gas cylinders to Nitish Kumar’s announcement of prohibition and cycles to school-going girl students to Mamata Banerjee’s cash hand-outs to young and unmarried girl students, astute politicians were quick to recognise the power of the women’s vote. Both surveys and anecdotal evidence indicate that women are playing a crucial role in determining electoral outcomes — and they do this on the overall performance of the government and the specific measures outlined for women’s welfare. In the upcoming assembly elections, parties have made promises with an eye on the women vote — from direct income allowances and pensions to homemakers to reservations in jobs to benefits for women from marginalised groups.%s
Among the changes, the most significant is that of Dattatreya Hosabale’s elevation as the sarkaryavah (general secretary), the de facto executive head of the organisation with the responsibility of day-to-day management of the Sangh’s vast activities. This team will lead the Sangh’s centenary celebrations in 2025; take forward its mission of “uniting Hindu society”; expand its organisational footprint; and play a key part in the coordination between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government at the Centre and in states and other institutional affiliates. And the fact that while being wedded to the Sangh’s ideological framework, Mr Hosabale is among its more suave and modern faces may also mean a slight shift in Sangh’s external projection. There is, of course, close ideological convergence between the Sangh and the BJP, reflected in the government’s push on Kashmir and the construction of the Ram temple, and reports of divergence are often exaggerated.%s
A recent United Nations report suggests that there is a global water crisis due to population growth, the nature of economic growth, the climate crisis, land-use change, inefficient water use, and weak planning and enforcement. The report also pointed to the need for measures to help more than three billion people who either lack access to safe drinking water or face periodic water shortages. For safe and constant supply water, the government must promote community-based water conservation, push citizens to harvest rainwater, and stop destroying wetlands and catchment areas.%s
This is based on India’s military needs; it has been decided at the highest levels of India’s political leadership, taking into account all variables; it is a commitment to Moscow, which, notwithstanding recent differences, has been an old friend of India; and it is in keeping with New Delhi’s sovereign right to ensure its national security. Does Washington want to dilute this growing strategic trust with New Delhi by implementing its sanctions framework or will it prioritise the big picture of deepening ties to address the “most pressing challenge facing the Indo Pacific region”, as Mr Austin put it, and waive off sanctions? On the eve of Mr Austin’s visit, the Senate foreign relations committee chair, Robert Menendez, asserted that India’s purchase will be a “sanctionable” transaction. There remains a substantial segment of opinion in India — in government, defence forces and the strategic community — which is wary of Washington, especially given the baggage of history. Sanctions Act (CAATSA) is meant to, among other things, deter Russia’s defence industry clients with the threat of secondary sanctions.%s
A few hours later, when the day’s new Covid-19 cases were tallied from all states, the total came to 35,836 new infections — the highest number of single-day cases in the country in more than 100 days. In India’s worst-hit state, Maharashtra, Wednesday’s case toll (23,179) was the highest single-day rise since September 17, 2020 — Testing numbers have been steadily dropping; the concept of contact-tracing has been reduced to just getting immediate family members of positive cases tested; and mask etiquette, as well as enforcement of social distancing norms, are near non-existent even in metros, leave alone smaller cities or rural areas. The best way to fight the second wave, apart from strictly instituting Covid-19 management protocols, is to use the one advantage that the country did not have a year ago — vaccines.%s
What would the new football world order look like?The man tipped to be the next emperor of the game is already a rising star; France and PSG striker Kylian Mbappe is only 22 and his explosive pace, flair for dribbling and phenomenal skills make him a natural frontrunner to the throne. Perhaps, the post Messi-Ronaldo era will not be dominated by one or two ultra-prolific goal-scorers like Mbappe or Haaland, but by that most vital cog of this team sport — a midfield maestro. Is world football entering a new era, one that does not revolve around just two names — Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo? he is tall (6ft4), but has the agility and mobility that’s usually the preserve of players of Messi’s height (5ft7).%s
The TSR Subramaniam Committee, which was set up in 2014, proposed a new model umbrella law, Environment Law (Management Act) or ELMA, incorporating the concept of “utmost good faith” where applicants of environment or forest clearance are responsible for their statements. The Centre also failed to come up with a sound explanation for the scrapping of CAQM and its plans to tackle air pollution, even as new data released by a Swiss organisation, IQAir, said that 22 of the 30 most polluted cities in the world are in India.%s
On Monday, the Centre tabled a bill introducing an amendment to the legislative framework that forms the basis for governance in Delhi — the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) Bill, 2021. L-G’s powers, from the realm of police, public order and land, to include all other decisions by the elected government, which will now have to go to L-G for prior consultation. But there is little sense in diluting the existing (and limited) powers of the state government, and taking Delhi back to a framework of centralised control, which is what the amendment may do. Global examples show that most federal governments, for reasons of security and administrative ease, retain a substantial degree of control over capital territories, even if there is variation in the scope of powers. Three, it weakens the power of the Delhi assembly and its committees to take up issues related to day-to-day administration of the Capital and conduct inquiries in relation to administrative decisions.%s
For voters, access to power, often, depends on whether a member of one’s own group is the directly elected representative who can ensure services to constituents belonging to that caste group, or if a party that is broadly sensitive to one’s group interests is in power. Issues such as the performance of the state government, welfare schemes, governance promises of an Opposition party, the interplay of urbanisation, mobility, migration and enhanced aspiration of citizens across castes, the role of media and social media, the popularity of local candidates, and the organisational strength of various forces in competition play an important role. In Tamil Nadu, even as the ruling National Democratic Alliance combine hopes to win over the support of Hindu sub-castes through social engineering, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam-led alliance is hoping to create its social coalition of backward communities, Dalits and Muslims. For politicians, it is much easier to appeal to group identities, when group identities serve as the basis for social organisation, to consolidate their base and polarise.%s
Coupled with the monetisation of assets, as proposed in the budget, this will herald a major change in India’s political economy, where, over time, the State will retreat from directly managing companies and assets and confine itself to a broader regulatory and oversight rule. A key government initiative this year will be the proposed privatisation of public sector enterprises, while the State will confine itself to the bare minimum presence in strategic sectors. It includes building a strong intellectual case for privatisation — while reassuring those who fear that they will bear the brunt of the consequences of reforms.%s
It has complex sociological roots, from family elders in politics prodding their young to take on the same professional route to issues of trust since party finances are closely controlled within a circle of trust; from the political ambition of those who can see a short-cut to state power because of family links to mass support for a family brand. An actor who became active in the party’s youth wing, Udhaynidhi Stalin will have to rise through the party’s hierarchy just as his father did — but being a third-generation dynast gives him a natural edge. From poll strategy to finances, public relations to intra-party issues, Mr Banerjee is playing an important role — with speculation rife that he is being groomed as the party’s next leader.%s
While the BJP may improve its vote share in the state, the outcome in Kerala is important because it will determining the balance of power within the broad national Opposition, especially between Congress and non-Congress forces. The Left lost power in Bengal in 2011 and has become so marginal in the state’s polity that it will be lucky to come a distant third this time around. The state is also critical for the Congress, for Kerala offers the best chance for the party to come to power.%s
What started as a bottoming out of the case trajectory in the second half of February has now become a steady stream of rising infections in the past week or so, pushing the pandemic back to a case rate last seen at the end of December. Big congregations — political, religious, cultural, farmer protests, weddings, election rallies — all face risks of turning into super-spreading events. Lately though, testing has dropped significantly — the testing rate in the last week in India was 40% below peak capacity levels. Out of India’s 20 most populous cases, 17 states and Union Territories have seen their trajectories rise significantly after bottoming out — this list includes Punjab, Delhi, Haryana and Madhya Pradesh. But while this is a good start, it is time to expand the eligibility criteria to include younger people — after all, they are the ones most mobile, and most likely to be the ones spreading the virus.%s
If secular politics, in the past, was electorally equated with being seen as sensitive to Muslim aspirations, secular politicians, today, are investing all their energy in both, not being seen as pro-Muslim, and being seen as adequately sensitive to Hindu sentiments. Mr Kejriwal has, for at least three years now, been carefully portraying himself as a Hindu leader — advertising his devotion to Hanuman, staying away from potentially polarising issues such as the Shaheen Bagh agitation and organising pujas under state government auspices, among other steps. The Congress has attempted to do this too, most recently seen in the Rajasthan government’s decision to legalise mining to supply stones to the Ram temple construction. As a Hindustan Times data-based analysis showed, Ms Banerjee’s efforts at countering possible political polarisation on religious lines did not stop at the level of rhetoric.%s
The package — which was a key electoral plank of Mr Biden — includes direct income assistance; extension of unemployment benefits; financial support for expedited vaccination; relief for schools; support for infrastructure; and tax credits for children, among other steps. In the United States (US), the Congress has passed a $1.9-trillion stimulus package, shepherded by the Joe Biden administration, to aid citizens, especially among low-income and poorer segments, in times of the economic distress caused by Covid-19. The package is extraordinary for its scale, and is in line with a central Keynesian principle — enhanced public spending will spur demand and have a multiplier effect.%s
In fact, Covid-19, which Haryana uses as a rationale to lobby for reopening mining, has shown how deforestation, changes in forest habitats, poorly regulated agricultural surfaces, and mismanaged urban growth can create a fertile ground for pandemics. While economic growth is important for improving the lives and livelihoods of citizens, governments must understand that unsustainable development may lead to short-term gains, but will spell disaster for citizens, the economy and the country in the long-term. In its petition, Haryana said the ban on mining was forcing the state to pay extra for sourcing minerals from adjoining states, and this higher cost was also affecting public projects.%s
But Mr Rawat’s ascension, a result of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) central leadership asking Trivendra Singh Rawat to put in his papers after internal discontent, cannot just be explained as yet another instance of the political churn in states which are still in the process of institutionalising their party systems and political culture. The episode also throws up an interesting facet of political leadership in democracies — the criticism against the outgoing CM was that he relied excessively on bureaucrats and ignored political inputs. It is in this backdrop of larger instability, both due to intra-party and inter-party issues, in some of India’s younger, smaller states, that Uttarakhand will now have a new chief minister, Tirath Singh Rawat. In the current case though, the BJP leadership gave in — primarily because the criticism against Trivendra Singh Rawat was emanating from within BJP’s own legislative ranks and from the larger ideological fraternity.%s
The British monarchy has gone through its share of crises — from more personal controversies around Prince Charles and Princess Diana’s marriage to political challenges, including a republican strain which sees the institution as antiquated and out of line with the democratic spirit of modern times. While the entire episode may be seen as yet another internal dispute of the elite, it has created a crisis of credibility for the royal family — for charges of racism from within are hard to counter. But few episodes will do as much damage to the credibility of the monarchy as an institution as the interview of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, Harry and Megan Markle, who have walked away from the royal family to begin life anew in the United States (%s
At the same time, India must focus on building water storage capacities in the Northeast so that its needs are not compromised in case of a natural or man-made crisis; draw benefits from its own rivers; and focus on building a lower riparian coalition of Pakistan, Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh and Myanmar to lobby international support for recognising Tibet’s water as a common resource. While pushing China for seamless data-sharing on Brahmaputra-related aspects such as rainfall and water flow (irrespective of the politics of the day), New Delhi must strive to make water a core issue for bilateral dialogue along with the boundary matter. While India, as an upper riparian neighbour, has always opted for a treaty-based approach with Pakistan, Nepal, Bhutan and Bangladesh, China’s approach with 11 of its neighbours with whom it shares rivers, has been more unilateral. But some other experts say that this is an unwarranted concern because the Brahmaputra’s volume is determined not so much by the water flowing into India from Tibet as it is by monsoon-fed tributaries of the river that originate in Arunachal Pradesh. The issue of building dams on the Yarlung Zangbo, which China views as necessary for generating clean electricity and meeting its climate goals, has, for long, evoked two kinds of responses in India.
