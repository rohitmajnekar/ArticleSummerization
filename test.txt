The commission should look into the manner in which key decisions over the past year were taken –  from the government’s initial responses (including the sudden lockdown) to the systems that were put in place to expand critical care, its vaccine policy, the collection of data, the raising of funds through PM-CARES, the allocation of medical resources across states, the attempts to gag the media and even patients, the nature and appropriateness of official and ministerial pronouncements, etc. Also read: Behind the Lives Lost During the Pandemic Lie India’s Failing Public InstitutionsSuch a commission must have the power to summon and examine all relevant officials and documents, including the inputs, if any, that were sought or received from official and non-official experts at each stage of decision making. If this is true, then the prime minister’s personal culpability and indeed criminal negligence get heightened because he disregarded not just common sense but expert opinion by choosing to go ahead with massive election meetings and the Kumbh Mela in Haridwar, and not taking steps to boost the preparedness of the public health system. Modi declared premature victory over COVID-19 and consequently the Centre’s COVID-19 task force, which had stopped meeting regularly, took its eyes off critical aspects of disease management despite the inevitability of the second wave. As the devastating second surge of the SARS-CoV-2 virus continues unabated, the Supreme Court and multiple high courts have been looking at various dimensions of the gross mismanagement of the public health crisis across the country. While the high courts are mainly going into aspects relating to immediate relief for people suffering from the lack of oxygen, medicines and hospital beds, the Supreme Court has raised the larger question of the right to health as an extension of the right to life flowing from Article 21 of the constitution. These deliberations are welcome, but there is also a pressing need to set up a formal judicial commission of inquiry with at least three sitting Supreme Court judges to take a 360-degree look at how India’s COVID-19 management system collapsed and came to this sorry pass. Rakesh Mishra, a member of the Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genome Sequencing Consortia (INSACOG) – which is in charge of identifying and studying the behaviour of virus variants in the country – said recently that experts had warned in early March that it was “very, very clear [that] there is real danger and a threatening situation The second omission is particularly galling considering India’s claim to be the “pharmacy of the world”.The current wave of infections may recede on its own in a few weeks but will we go back to our old ways then? The intensity of the second surge can be gauged from the simple statistic that it took India 12 months to reach 10 million recorded cases but just four months to hit 20 million.%s
The new Information Technology rules notified by the government give unprecedented powers to the executive to summarily take down content from digital news media platforms on vague grounds, and without so much as giving the publisher a hearing. The move has shocked the entire news media fraternity which had presumed the new regulations would cover mainly social media platforms and entertainment segments like OTT players who have been in a dialogue with the government for some time now. All news media will be affected by the emergency powers to take news content down without giving publishers a hearing. Industry players are describing this as the government’s way of “regulating self-regulation”.While regulation of these other segments was being contemplated, the news media segment never expected it would get clubbed within the same regulatory regime. Worse, the new rules give emergency powers to the secretary, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting to censor digital news content without consulting the publisher. And this is being done in the name of regulating all internet-based media platforms across the board – including news, entertainment, OTT Apps like Netflix, Hotstar and big social platforms like Facebook, Twitter etc. The government has disingenuously extended the Information Technology Act 2000, which governs online platform accountability, to control digital news content through the backdoor,  without subjecting it to legislative discussion. Legal experts opine that putting online news content in the same basket as those governed under the IT Act is ultra vires the act  and a clear violation of free speech guaranteed under Article 19(1)(a)of the constitution.%s
Since a constitution is only as good as the guarantee of its enforceability, it is a matter of great misfortune that this year’s ‘celebration’ comes amidst a worrying debate over whether one of keys to the constitution’s enforcement – Article 32 – may be getting diluted. If judges now start believing – as Chief Justice S.A. Bobde said during the bail hearing of journalist Siddique Kappan – that the ordinary citizen’s recourse to Article 32 needs to be “discouraged’, they might as well sign the death warrant for the constitution’s soul. India’s Temple Is its Secular ConstitutionSome commentators have described the possible dilution of the “basic structure doctrine” as the advent of “judicial barbarism” which has followed what large sections of the citizenry have experienced in terms of the hijacking of their basic democratic rights over the past six years. Whether it is the government’s authoritarian approach to Kashmir, the passage of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, the blatantly partisan investigation of the Delhi riots, the continued incarceration without bail of intellectuals and activists in the fraudulent Bhima Koregaon case and more recently the arrest and harassment of journalists, November 26, 2020 is is actually a day for mourning Samvidhan Divas, not celebrating it. It is also about the erosion of the cumulative achievement via decades of a progressive jurisprudence centred around the “basic structure doctrine” as outlined by The Wire’s legal editor V.Venkatesan in a series of important articles. This is the biggest question people need to ponder over on Samvidhan Divas 2020.Finally, this Constitution Day, let us specially remember all the prisoners of conscience who are in jail with no recourse to bail – from the octogenarians Stan Swamy and Varavara Rao to the young students being framed for the Delhi riots and all the women and men in between. The Right to Dissent is the Most Important Right Granted by the Constitution: Justice GuptaThe real disappointment for citizens facing such an unprecedented assault on their basic democratic rights is not that the Modi regime and its hatchet men are behaving the way they are.%s
The steady stream of half-baked ‘evidence’ flowing from the official investigation into those news channels which are leading the charge seems aimed at keeping a particular narrative going; the extent to which ignorant investigators and moronic media are working in tandem became clear when a text message from Rhea Chakraborty with the millennial phrase ‘Imma bounce’ (translation; ‘I’m leaving’) became a sensational news break on Times Now – a news channel owned by India’s biggest media house – about how the young woman was conspiring to bounce a cheque!Also read: The Curious Case of the Bihar Top Cop in the Limelight In TV’s rush to drown viewers in diversionary noise, Chakraborty stands a condemned woman, with all manner of accusations hurled at her – a manipulating girlfriend who stole money from her partner Sushant Singh Rajput, was on drugs and perhaps abetted or at least conspired to have him killed. On nightly television news – whose anchors serve as judge, jury and executioner in all matters – she has been vilified beyond all known limits of journalistic ethics, to say nothing of human decency. All of these wild charges are based on a deadly cocktail of innuendo, constant vilification on social media and unending sensational coverage of what was initially thought to be a simple case of death by suicide. Also read: Rhea Chakraborty’s Trial by Media Reflects Entrenched MisogynyWhatever dubious information this process has produced has been presented to the public as hard fact, without a shred of evidence. The Indian viewer is used to this level of media hysteria, of course, but if and when the history of media transgressions is written, #SSR will surely make it to the top three cases in recent times.%s
BluffOther examples include withholding data, thus denying journalists and experts the ability to check results in the full context in which they are to be understood; distorting or miscommunicating data, as is often the case with the infection fatality rate; removing data, such as by taking down documents containing information about the number of individuals tested by date before April 24; denying others’ claims but with insufficient data, thus adding to the confusion, as with the preprint paper that claimed India’s epidemic would peak in November; and publicising some findings by leaking them to the press. As a result, until the paper becomes available, ICMR stands guilty of the same charge that Patanjali Ayurved has been accused of: doing science by press release, i.e. to expose one’s results to non-expert people before it has been vetted by other experts. This is unacceptable because ICMR is not just India’s council for medical research but the principal fount of scientific knowledge vis-à-vis India’s COVID-19 epidemic. For example, on June 8, three days before the press conference, the New Indian Express reported that the seroprevalence survey had found that “as high as one-third of the population in many containment areas in hotspot cities may have already been infected by the virus and quietly recovered”. More than a month after Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) researchers conducted an important seroprevalence survey, a published paper with the methods and results is nowhere in sight. Perhaps the most egregious example is ICMR’s inexplicable love affair with hydroxychloroquine, in which the body made some decisions that flew so directly in the face of evidence and ethics that it was hard to believe a well-reasoned rebuttal would be taken seriously. The last point is particularly dangerous because it allows ICMR researchers to get the results of their studies into the public domain but without opening up the body to be questioned on their validity or, for that matter, to be seen as questioning any official policy. While publishing delays are not implicitly wrong, even during a pandemic – it is better to take the time and publish a good paper than to publish a bad paper in a hurry –%s
As we had said in an editorial note five years ago, we wanted to “reimagine the media as a joint venture in the public sphere between journalists, readers and a concerned citizenry. But as our readers and viewers will testify, the bet we took on the main advantage of being non-profit – that it would help our journalism remain fiercely independent – has proved a winning one. In the aftermath of the lockdown, people who rarely get space in the ‘mainstream’ media – despite constituting the national mainstream – have forced their way into our consciousness. There is also a growing cadre of freelance journalists in every part of the country who pursue stories in the public interest and who help ensure the wilful silence of the Big Media is broken. But even as digital media has flourished, offering a wide variety of choices to a readership that virtually lives online, the same cannot be said for the news industry as a whole, or for journalism as a craft. But digital journalism in India is barely older than half a decade and has, in this short period, faced many challenges – from rapid changes in technology to revenue constraints and official hostility. But India still has newspapers, TV channels and websites willing to fight the good fight, and a large number of journalists – The Wire’s mission is to bring public interest journalism to its readers and viewers and we know you will continue to support us. In a media landscape where some newspapers have a history going back nearly 200 years, a fifth anniversary may appear inconsequential. Across India, journalists have risen to the occasion and told their stories, even while some media houses have tried to ridicule them. Many well-known newspapers and television channels have become glorified gazettes for the government, highlighting its claims and reserving their criticism for its opponents.%s
The images flooding television screens for the past few nights, along with reports by journalists from numerous organisations who had all been subject to the mob’s vicious attacks, brought back stark memories of 1984 – the last time Delhi was in the throes of such organised communal violence – or 2002, when the state of Gujarat under Narendra Modi burned for weeks. Apart from Kapil Mishra, party legislators and functionaries have either openly inciting anti-Muslim hatred or helped demonise the anti-CAA protests – which have all been peaceful – as anti-national. The utter chaos and lawlessness which reigned unchecked on the watch of the Narendra Modi government at the Centre – which controls law and order in the national capital – has left at least 21 people dead, including a policeman, and several hundred injured. While Union home minister Amit Shah has been missing in action, the junior home minister has now set his sights on the media – demanding action against news platforms whose reports of the violence have proved embarrassing for the government. But there are also deeper underlying factors – institutional and political – which helped push Delhi into the abyss. Ordinary working people – both Hindus and Muslims – have died in the orchestrated mayhem. ’s polarising politics around the question of citizenship – can expect no succour from such partisan law enforcers. Given the nature of the mobs and their leaders, the violence quickly lost any pretence of a ‘political’ motive and descended into crude, generalised communal violence against Muslims.%s
And of course social media is awash with fake memes, pumped up nationalism, and the naming and shaming of all those ‘enemies of the nation’ – from leftist students to liberals to the much-reviled ‘prestitutes’ – for not succumbing to the jingoist fervour. With Lok Sabha elections around the corner, every effort is being made to get the voter to think that the nation needs to unite behind one man – a decisive leader who can give a fitting reply to those who threaten the country. A narrative has been spun in the aftermath of the suicide bomb attack that killed 44 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) soldiers in Pulwama that it is somehow unpatriotic to ask questions about the role that intelligence and policy failures might have played. From demanding that Kashmiri students be thrown out of their institutions to asking landlords to not keep Kashmiri tenants, there is a concerted attempt underway to corner people from the state. In Punjab, the Bharatiya Janata Party and its supporters have gone after Navjot Singh Siddhu for his statement that an entire country – Pakistan – could not be blamed for the actions of a few. It is possible to express sorrow at the death of soldiers and condemn terrorism from across the border while at the same time asking legitimate questions about intelligence failure. Indians are angry at the killing of the jawans but let us be clear about one thing: anyone who tries to turn this anger into violence against fellow citizens is essentially doing the dirty work of the Jaish-e-Mohammad for them. In Ahmedabad, there are demands from hyper-patriots that people boycott Gujarat Samachar, a leading daily, for a critical headline implying the terrorists had been emboldened under Narendra Modi’s government.%s
The home minister has pointedly mentioned Shaheen Bagh in his speeches, and left no doubt in anyone’s mind that voting against the BJP would be an endorsement of the protestors, and thus, by implication, supportive of the nation’s enemies. The young man’s action is a logical step forward in a sequence of mob lynchings, the unprovoked beating of students by storm troopers, heavy-handed police action against peaceful protestors and the like. There may be many – scores, if not hundreds – of such radicals, all indoctrinated by the unending lies spread by the pro-government Hindutva-oriented ecosystem, which consists of politicians, social media and also a large section of mainstream media. The protestors at Jamia Millia Islamia, where the shooting took place, and Shaheen Bagh, where hundreds of women have been sitting on the streets for weeks to register their opposition to the CAA and National Register of Citizens, have been painted as anti-nationals; that many of them are Muslim has figured prominently in the BJP’s messaging. The junior finance minister in the Narendra Modi government makes a speech in Delhi in which he exhorts the audience to shout ‘Desh ke gaddaron ko, goli maro salon ko (Shoot the traitors)’, a pointed reference to those who are protesting the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. As long as he continues to seek electoral dividends by exploiting anti-minority sentiments – and his latest speech indicates there is to be no let up – In the BJP’s mind, violence and anti-minority propaganda will lead to polarisation and the party believes it will reap electoral benefits from this strategy.%s
The Bias Against Muslims in the CAA-NRC Fulfils a Promise the BJP Made in 1996The illegal manner in which people have been denied the right to peacefully oppose the government’s move – the misuse of Section 144, detentions and beatings, internet shutdowns – has widened the ambit of the protests, which are no longer just about the CAA and NRC. The prime minister has claimed that the National Register of Citizens – which will divide Indians into ‘citizens’ and ‘doubtful citizens’ – is not even at the discussion stage in official circles. In fact, the hundreds of thousands of citizens out on the streets, braving lathis and bullets, chanting slogans and singing songs and vociferously raising their voice against the government, are now fighting for the constitution, for India’s foundational principles, for their democratic rights. That is why the protests have not slowed, and even the violence by the police in different parts of the country – mainly in BJP-ruled states – has not deterred citizens from coming out on the streets. While the BJP privately tells its supporters that this ‘trishul’ is aimed at Muslims alone, the fact is that millions of Indian citizens are likely to have their lives upended by the party’s insistence that they prove their citizenship. From Assam to Kerala, from Mumbai to Kolkata and in Delhi, Lucknow and Mangalore, Kasargode, Vijayawada and Aurangabad, Indians, young and old, cutting across religion and caste, have come out to let the government know that they will not stay silent in the face of a brazen attempt to ride roughshod over India’s democracy. It is a government’s responsibility to show the country a clear, consistent and consultative legal framework for any policy on this order of significance. His assurance is completely contradicted by home minister Amit Shah’s statements inside Parliament and outside that the exercise will be rolled out all over the country by 2024. As of today, the government has still not decided what the metric will be, but given bureaucratic inefficiency, corruption and sheer cussedness, ‘mistakes’ are bound to happen on a large scale. Instead it continuously shifts, contradicts, denies its own claims – broad and detailed – and has only confirmed popular fears of its bad faith.%s
While it is far-fetched to suggest the woman – or those who reported her claims – had defamed him, the UP CM had the option of filing a civil defamation suit or even a criminal defamation case and seeking an injunction against further coverage of the ‘love story’. What makes the police action in his case – and the related arrests of Ishika Singh and Anuj Shukla of a small Noida-based TV channel, National Live – especially sinister is that journalists are being directly victimised for covering and commenting on a story that incurred the wrath of a powerful politician. Thus the police crossed state lines and arrested Kanojia on the basis of an FIR so flimsy that the two provisions cited – Section 66 of the Information Technology Act (on hacking computer systems) and Section 500 of the Indian Penal Code (on criminal defamation) ­– simply did not provide the requisite grounds. The arrest of Prashant Kanojia fits the now familiar pattern of various state governments – from Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal to Odisha, Maharashtra and Karnataka – abusing sundry provisions of the law to silence individual voices on social media. It is hardly surprising that chief ministers elsewhere – like H.D. Kumaraswamy of Karnataka – treat free speech with the same sort of contempt. Orders went out to arrest him but no one bothered to inform the police that India’s constitutional guarantee of free speech extends to satire and humour and that there was no provision of law that would allow them to take him into custody.%s
Worse, it invoked its in-house procedure to handle her complaint and refused to include an outside expert as a member of the all-judges panel or make the senior-most woman judge on the court its head (as the internal complains committee process would have required) or even a member. Sadly, the court compounded this lapse of judgment on his part with its decision to set up a probe, headed by a former judge, to look into allegations that the woman who complained against the CJI is part of some wider conspiracy to fix judgments in the Supreme Court. Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi found himself facing allegations of sexual harassment and victimisation by a former court employee, the Supreme Court was expected to deal with her complaint in a transparent and just manner. On Monday, the Supreme Court announced that the panel has decided the woman’s allegations against the CJI were unfounded. Unfortunately, when the occasion arose last month for the Supreme Court to apply those in a matter involving one of its own, it decided not to follow the system it had prescribed for other workplaces but instead set in motion two parallel inquiries of such staggering opacity that the fruits of their labour were tainted at the outset. Shaken by what she said was the panel’s lack of sensitivity and indifference to due process, the woman withdrew from the proceedings mid-way. What is not difficult to establish is the highly unusual punishment – dismissal, no less – meted out to the woman soon after the alleged incident. Instead of abandoning the ‘in-house’ path and creating a committee that both the complainant and the wider public could have confidence in, the panel headed by Justice S.A. Bobde continued with its exertions, ex parte.%s
The BJP’s recently launched manifesto, Sankalpit Bharat – Sashakt Bharat, declaring “nationalism” to be its “inspiration,” has promised to abrogate Articles 370 and 35A in Jammu and Kashmir, pass the communal Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, construct the Ram temple at Ayodhya – each one of these promises loaded with potential conflict and strife, especially against India’s Muslims. That the party, which barely had an electoral presence prior to 2014, has emerged as the main opposition party within just five years, has much to do with the party’s divisive, anti-Muslim campaign and rhetoric in the state. An Unprecedented Poll Campaign of Invoking Fear and HostilityIt is in keeping with this dangerously divisive strategy that BJP president Amit Shah at a rally in Bengal’s Raiganj described Bangladeshi immigrants as “termites”. Six Months?We must also emphasise that the party’s strategy of pitting communities against each other, riling up a majoritarian base against vulnerable minority communities, is not confined to any one state. Trinamool Congress chief minister Mamata Banerjee on the mat for pursuing a “politics of appeasement” and harbouring “illegal Bangladeshi migrants ” or his allusion to Rahul Gandhi’s decision to contest from Wayanad because it is a constituency where the “minority is majority Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s divisive speech at a rally in Wardha in the Vidarbha region, chastising the Congress for “insulting Hindus in front of the whole world, Addressing a rally in the communally sensitive district of Malda two months ago, the BJP president alleged that the Bengal government was “not allowing people to celebrate Saraswati puja”. That such hate mongering is spurring vigilante mobs to continue with their random attacks – often fatally – on innocent Muslim citizens across the country, seems to matter little to the ruling party at the centre. Describing all Bangladeshi immigrants as “infiltrators,” the top BJP leadership have gone all out to deepen the atmosphere of anxiety hanging over Assam and the rest of India.%s
India’s “non-military” military action against a Jaish-e-Muhammad establishment in Balakot, Pakistan and Pakistan’s retaliatory “non-relatiation” by dropping bombs on locations in Rajouri have brought the two countries to a crossroads. Kinetic operations may yield benefits at the tactical level in the fight against terrorism but it is foolish to think the problem of terrorism can be defeated by military means alone. Since independence, India has fought four wars with Pakistan but the country’s political and military leadership always had clear and finite aims – even for the wars it did not initiate. Ending terrorism is a valid objective of Indian policy but only jingoist anchors and retired military hotheads on television believe this can be done by going up the escalatory ladder whose first rung was the airstrike on Balakot. Also read: The Airstrikes Had Three Targets, But Hit Bullseye in Just OnePakistan has an obligation to act against terrorist groups on its soil and Prime Minister Imran Khan needs to be clear that his offer of dialogue, if not matched by evidence on the ground of action against the Jaish-e-Mohammad and others, will never yield anything – even if the Indian side were to grasp it, which we hope it will.%s
The acts of violence were accompanied by the mob chanting “Death to Malini Subramaniam.”A report of the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) revealed that 48 journalists were killed in India between 1992 and 2018. That between 2006 and 2017 nearly 1,010 journalists were killed and that in nine out of ten cases the killers have gotten away, is a sombre reminder of the dangers journalists have to confront in their day-to-day work. The ongoing political conflicts in different parts of the country – from Kashmir and insurgency-affected states in the Northeast to Maoist-impacted Chhattisgarh – have exposed journalists working in these contexts to grave danger. The killing of several journalists over the last few years in India is a reminder that those who object to free speech – especially when it involves liberal ideas – will stop at nothing to quell those voices. Like their global counterparts, Indian journalists are confronting a host of occupational hazards, grappling with daunting legal and extra-legal challenges and even risking their lives to bring information in the public domain. If journalists in prime locations and metropolitan cities are under attack, those away from media and public glare, spread out in small towns and villages, are preyed upon with far greater ease. That stark statistic testifies to the ubiquity of violence, bringing home the gravity of the situation, indicating the levels of risk journalists increasingly take to just do their jobs. Growing intolerance of dissenting journalists has manifested itself in various forms across the nation – from censorship fiats to acts of outright physical intimidation. The call was issued by the UNESCO at its 68th session in 2013 in remembrance of two French journalists killed in Mali that year. Independence and fearless thought, usually considered to be invaluable journalistic attributes, are now becoming a serious – even dangerous – hindrance for media professionals. ’s call to mark November 2 as the International Day to End the Culture of Impunity for Crimes Against Journalists.%s
As the state upscales weaponisation, increases the presence of security forces on the ground and violates the basic human rights of adivasis in the name of fighting the insurgents, the Maoists too have sought to enhance their striking ability.  Whichever way you look at the conflict, the biggest victims of the continued low-intensity war across central India are the adivasis.  And if and when civilians are caught in the crossfire (like the Doordarshan photographer, for instance), they are written off as mere ‘collateral damage’.  Not only have the adivasis been historically denied their rights and access to basic services, they have also borne the brunt of the conflict between the state and the Maoists.  In fact, it may be argued that the historic process of adivasi displacement has gone on unabated even as industrialists aided by the state have made huge profits from doing business in these mineral-rich areas.   The Salwa Judum – a vigilante organisation created by the state and banned by the Supreme Court – and its more recent avatars have made matters worse.  Can targeted or random killings – of officials as much as of civilians – redeem the flaws that have come to subvert conventional systems of democracy, including electoral democracy, in India? Equally important to the discussion is the question of state-sponsored violence.  The infamous kangaroo courts the Maoists preside over are yet another insidious way of inflicting violence on adivasis. Adivasis are routinely subjected to police violence and harassment.  Democracy needs to be part of any political movement for it to impact the lives of the very people the movement claims to defend and fight for. Can the assassination of ordinary civilians and also of men and women in uniform provide justice long denied to the poor and the oppressed?Let us consider the recent spiral of violence.%s
In the past 48 hours, survivors have come forward and provided credible accounts of specific incidents in which editors have forced themselves on journalists working under them, as well as of instances of workplace harassment by male colleagues, and persistent and unwanted sexual attention. Dark Underbelly of Indian Media Revealed as Scores of Journalists Say #MeTooEven if India’s sexual harassment law at the workplace envisages a time limit for the filing of complaints, media organisations must waive those limits. Beyond this, changing the culture of the newsroom in a larger, gender inclusive way is the key to putting an end to the sexism and predatory culture seen in so many media organisations.§(The Internal Complaints Committee at The Wire is headed by our managing editor, Monobina Gupta. What is common to the incidents that survivors have narrated is that managements took little or no note of their complaints – obviously because they lacked clout in the organisation, thus making it doubly difficult to get any justice or redressal. Each incident is traumatic but when it comes bundled with a power dynamic, the effect is especially deadly – for the survivor, for the organisation where it takes places and for journalism as a profession. While there are concerns that names could be unfairly dragged in, accounts that contain details of who, what, where and how must be investigated, at the very least by the internal complaints committees of the various media organisations involved. The tsunami of revelations by women media professionals about being harassed by their bosses and colleagues has brought out into the open a dreadful pathology that was only whispered about so far. Women who speak out, giving their names and the exact sequence of events about incidents of harassment, do not do so frivolously; they know that there could be a price involved.%s
In constructing tourism, identity and regional pride around what the state calls ‘Gujarati Asmita,’ the state government has refused to part with any lions or partake in a much broader scientific strategy for lion conservation. Asking for an “ecocentric approach” that had the “species best-interest standard” in mind, the Supreme Court had in 2013 asked Gujarat to allow lions to repopulate in another habitat. The ecological hope is that if lions are translocated to Madhya Pradesh, the population will survive any epidemics or disease that could strike Gir, and eventually aid genetic robustness through the colonisation of a new habitat. Trapped in a web of state politics – despite both MP and Gujarat being BJP-ruled – the reserve awaits lions. While neither conservational nor judicial directions have guided Gujarat’s hand thus far, the death of a dozen lions should end the parochialism. While Gujarat has worked hard on lion conservation, it also seems its effort is only for its lions. It is unclear how long the coexistence will continue; several illegal practices like baiting wild lions for fun have also come to light.%s
The police raids on the homes and offices of lawyers, trade unionists, writers and rights activist and the subsequent arrest of five persons on Tuesday send a worrying signal about the state of India’s democracy. In keeping with the government’s style of functioning, pliant sections of the media have been pressed into action to vilify the arrested persons. Since the early grant of bail under UAPA is well-nigh impossible, the police know they need not bother to present proper evidence or formulate a credible charge against the arrested persons. As the 2019 elections draw near, a new narrative is being fostered – of an enemy within who is not just against the government and its policies, but against the nation itself. It is not a coincidence that the five individuals targeted have been fighting for the rights of workers, Adivasis, farmers, women, Dalits and all those at the receiving end of government policies. Whether it is Sudha Bharadwaj, the IIT-educated mathematician who runs a trade union in Chhattisgarh and practices law in the Bilaspur high court, or Gautam Navlakha, who has tirelessly fought for civil liberties through his writings, or the 79-year-old Marxist poet Indeed, the purpose behind levelling terrorism charges against prominent anti-establishment voices, including lawyers, is to intimidate actual or potential critics and ensure their silence. The burden of this propaganda campaign is that the five individuals arrested are somehow involved in the violence which erupted in parts of Maharashtra following the January 1 commemoration by Dalits of the colonial-era Bhima-Koregaon battle.%s
The morality that public perceives, the constitution may not conceive of,” and that what is “natural to one may not be natural to another”.In striking down the high court judgement, the Supreme Court four years later argued that only a minuscule proportion of the country’s population is made up of people with non-normative gender identities and sexual orientations, as if this supposedly insignificant minority had no right to protection. At a time when countries across the world are adopting more and more progressive and inclusive legislation, such as the legalisation of same-sex marriage, India’s refusal – on the basis of an outdated ‘moral’ framework – to decriminalise consensual sexual acts and relationships between adults is a blot on the republic. The latest bunch of petitions challenging Section 377 draws from this earlier nine-judge bench Puttaswamy judgment, in which the court observed that “equality demands that the sexual orientation of each individual in society must be protected on an even platform. As a five-judge Supreme Court constitution bench begins hearing petitions on scrapping Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, the Indian judiciary has yet another opportunity to redeem the injustice and discrimination the country’s LGBT community has been subjected to for decades. Further, the apex court said that fewer than 200 persons have been prosecuted under Section 377 in more than 15 years, which does not make Section 377 violative of Articles 14, 15 and 21 of the constitution. The right to privacy and the protection of sexual orientation lie at the core of the fundamental rights guaranteed by Articles 14, 15 and 21 of the constitution.
